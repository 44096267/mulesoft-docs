= About Designing and Implementing an API

This topic provides general information about designing and implementing an API using Anypoint Platform. It also describes the Anypoint Platform tools that enable you to design an implement an API.

== Design (RAML)

The first step in creating an API is to design an API specification. Anypoint Platform uses the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML)to build API specifications.

| Anypoint Studio | A unified graphical design environment enables you to build out APIs and Integration applications. Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse plugin that provides a drag-and-drop interface that enables you to build application flows from a collection of components.

In addition to defining a full API specifciation, you can also create API fragments. API fragments enable you to define reusable components that you can share with other API developers. Using these fragments you can create a a full API specification from reusable components.

Validate designs before writing any code with the mocking service

== Publish

After creating an API specification in RAML, you can publish you API to Anypoint Exchange.
Publishing your API enables both collaboration and discovery.
Collaboration enables you to work with other API designers and stake holders to further define and refine your API.
Discovery enables other members of your organization to know about and use your API.
Save your API into Anypoint Exchange for consumption in Design Center or Studio

== Implement

After your API has been finalized, Anypoint Platform also provides tools that enable you to implement your API as a working Mule application.
