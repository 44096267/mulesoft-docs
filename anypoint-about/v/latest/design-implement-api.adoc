= About Designing and Implementing an API

Anypoint Platform provides tools for designing, testing, and implementing an API.

== Publish

After creating an API specification in RAML, you can publish you API to Anypoint Exchange.
Publishing your API enables both collaboration and discovery.
Collaboration enables you to work with other API designers and stake holders to further define and refine your API.
Discovery enables other members of your organization to know about and use your API.

== Implement

After your API has been finalized, Anypoint Platform also provides tools that enable you to implement your API within a working application.

== Anypoint Design Center

The Anypoint Design Center is a set of complementary applications that enable you to design and test APIs, implement data and application integration flows, and build connectors.
