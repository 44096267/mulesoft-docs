This topic describes the different deployment scenarios provided by the Anypoint Platform. Each scenario differs based on whether Mulesoft manages the underlying infrastructure that runs the platform components.

This enables you to design, deploy, and manage an application network without maintaining the underlying hardware infrastructure. MuleSoft handles all of the scalability and high-availability requirements for the Anypoint Privatelatform.

Also, in this deployment scenario your Mule applications and APIs are deployed to CloudHub.

When Anypoint Platform is deployed to the MuleSoft Cloud, platform components are automatically upgraded as new versions are released. This ensures that you always have access to the most currrent features of the Anypoint Platform.

== Hybrid Cloud

In the hybrid deployment scenario, applications of the Anypoint Design and Management centers are hosted in the MuleSoft Cloud. Components of the Mule runtime are hosted in your own data center.
