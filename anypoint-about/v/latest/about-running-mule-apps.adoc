= About the Mule Runtime

After you have designed and implemented your application or API, you can deploy it to the Mule runtime. The Mule runtime runs cloud applications and enables you to apply policies. The Mule runtime is composed of the Mule runtime engine and supporting services.

== Mule Runtime Engine

The Mule runtime engine is the backbone of the application network. It is the runtime engine of Anypoint Platform that combines real-time application integration and orchestration with robust data integration capabilities.

The Mule runtime engine is a Java-base enterprise service bus (ESB) that can be run as a service on multiple operating systems.

== Anypoint Connectors

Anypoint Connectors provide quick and easy connectivity to an endpoint or dynamic connectivity to API specifications. They provide the assets and tools that enable you to connect to an application or data source. MuleSoft provides pre-built connectors that enable you to connect to a variety of data sources, SaaS applications, and more. You can also build your own connectors using the Connector DevKit.
