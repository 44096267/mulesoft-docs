= About Mule Applications

This topic provides general information about Mule applications and describes the Anypoint Platform components that enable you to create them.

A Mule application is a deployable, web-based application that enables you to 

Mule applications are built around one or more flows. Typically, a Mule application begins processing a message it receives at an inbound endpoint in a flow. In general, a flow performs one of the following:

* Implement all processing stages, or 
* Route the message to other flows or subflows to perform specific tasks.

To create flows within a Mule application, Anypoint Platform provides the following tools.

Mule applications are built around one or more flows. Typically, a Mule application begins processing a message it is received by an inbound endpoint in a flow. This flow can then either implement all processing stages, or route the message to other flows or subflows to perform specific tasks. Relative to the flow which triggered its execution, a flows and subflows can process messages either synchronously or asynchronously

Mule applications accept and process events as messages through several message processors. Message processors are arranged into a flow . A flow is the construct within which you link together several individual elements to handle the receipt, processing, and eventual routing of a message. the different types of elements in a flow.

Mule applications are made up of flows .Flow contains inbound endpoint from which message is received and it is processed by the message processors as per the way in which flow is designed. \

|===
| Component | Description
| Design Center | Provides a web-based editor that enables you to create a Mule application, create flows, and add connectors and components to a flow.
| Anypoint Studio | Provides an integrated IDE that enables you to build out Mule applications. Studio includes a flow editor that enables you to drag and drop components into a your application flow.
