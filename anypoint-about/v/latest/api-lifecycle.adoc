= About the API Life Cycle

Anypoint Platform enables you define and deploy APIs to specify how different components of your IT infrastructure to communicate and share data. Anypoint Platform also enable you to design, implement, deploy, and refine Mule applications based on an API. 

The set of tasks required to create this API is called the API life cycle. To perform the API Life Cycle tasks, Anypoint Platform provides a suite of tools that assist you in each stage of the API life cycle.

The following sections define each stage of the API life cycle and describe the Anypoint Platform tools used in each stage:

== Design an API

The first stage of the API life cycle is to design an API specification using the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML). RAML is an open source language, based on YAML, that defines how your API behaves and how it is used.

In addition to defining a full API specification, you can also create API fragments. API fragments enable you to define reusable components that you can share with other API developers. Using these fragments you can create a full API specification from reusable components.

Anypoint Platform provides the following tools for creating APIs and API fragments.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Component | Description
| Design Center | A web-based editor that enables you to define API specifications and fragments. Using Design Center, you can author, simulate, and validate an API. At any stage of the API design process, you can publish your API to Exchange to obtain feedback and collaborate with other API designers. 

In previous versions of Anypoint Platform, APIs were created and edited using Anypoint API Manager.
| Anypoint Studio | A unified IDE that enables you to build out APIs and Integration applications. Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse plugin that provides a drag-and-drop interface that enables you to build application flows from a collection of components.
|===


== Publish an API

After creating an API specification during the design phase, you can obtain feedback from other API designers by publishing your APIs. Publishing your API enables both collaboration and discovery. Collaboration enables you to work with other API designers and stake holders to further define and refine your API. Discovery enables other members of your organization to know about and use your API.

Anypoint Platform provides the following tool for publishing, discovering, and collaborating on APIs.

|Anypoint Exchange | A web-based application that provides a repository of Anypoint Platform components: connectors, templates, examples and APIs. You can use Anypoint Exchange to publish and manage your own components. Anypoint Exchange also enables you to discover and use proven assets built by the MuleSoft ecosystem, or add assets to a private tenant of Anypoint Exchange for collaboration and sharing of internal best practices.
|===

Exchange also provides enhanced discoverablitiy that promotes reuse by making it easier for collaborators and consumers to find your APIs. Exchange provides a central repository for sharing and discovering APIs of your organization. In Exchange, you can also publish best practices, templates, examples, and other types of information related to your API. 

After publishing your API to Anypoint Exchange, you or other users of your API can import it into Design Center or Studio.

In previous versions, collaboration and feeback were accomplished using functionality available in both Anypoint Exchange and API Manager. Both of these applications integrate directly with Anypoint Exchange to provide a single point of access for information and assets.


== Implement an API

After designing an API and publishing it to Anypoint Exchange, you can implement the API specification by creating a functioning Mule application. Anypoint platform provides two different environments for implementing a Mule application based on an API:

|===
| Component | Description
| Design Center | Provides a web-based editor that enables you to open an API as a RAML file then add implementation details. Design Center enables you to deploy a working Mule application. Or, you can republish the Mule application to Exchange for additional collaboration.
| Anypoint Studio | Provides an IDE that is fully integrated within the new API lifecycle. You can export a project from Design enter and load it in Studio.
|===


== Deploy an API or Mule Application



== Manage an API

After deploying your Mule application, you can also define policies that specify how your APIs are accessed and who has access to them. You can define policies using Anypoint API Manager. You can deploy them from Anypoint Runtime Manager.

You can also manage and monitor a running application using Anypoint Runtime Manager.
