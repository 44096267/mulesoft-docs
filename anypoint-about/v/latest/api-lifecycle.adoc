= About the API Life Cycle

Anypoint Platform enables you to design, implement, deploy, and refine Mule applications that you create based on an API definition. The set of tasks required to create this API is called the API Life Cycle. To perform the tasks of the API Life Cycle tasks, Anypoint Platform provides multiple components that assist you in each stage of the API lifecycle.

The following sections define each stage of the API lifecycle and describe the tools Anypoint Platform provides to support each stage:

== Design an API

The first stage of the API lifecycle is to create an API specification using the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML). RAML is an open source language, based on YAML, that defines how your API behaves and how it is used.

In addition to defining a full API specifciation, you can also create API fragments. API fragments enable you to define reusable components that you can share with other API developers. Using these fragments you can create a full API specification from reusable components.

Anypoint Platform provides the following tools for creating APIs and API fragments.

|===
| Component | Description
| Design Center | A web-based editor that enables you to define API specifications and fragments. Using Design Center, you can author, simulate, and validate an API. At any stage of the API design process, you can publish your API to Exchange 2.0 to obtain feedback and collaborate with other API designers. 

In previous versions of Anypoint Platform, APIs were created and edited using Anypoint API Manager.
| Anypoint Studio | A unified IDE that enables you to build out APIs and Integration applications. Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse plugin that provides a drag-and-drop interface that enables you to build application flows from a collection of components.
|===


== Publish an API

After creating an API specification during the design phase, you can obtain feedback and collaborate with other API designers by publishing your APIs. Publishing your API enables both collaboration and discovery. Collaboration enables you to work with other API designers and stake holders to further define and refine your API. Discovery enables other members of your organization to know about and use your API.

Anypoint Platform provides the following tools for publishing, discovering, and collaborating on APIs.

|Anypoint Exchange | A web-based application that provides a repository of Anypoint Platform components: connectors, templates, examples and APIs. You can use Anypoint Exchange to publish and manage your own components. Anypoint Exchange also enables you to discover and use proven assets built by the MuleSoft ecosystem, or add assets to a private tenant of Anypoint Exchange for collaboration and sharing of internal best practices.
|===

Exchange 2.0 also provides enhanced discoverablitiy that enhances reuse by making it easier for collaborators and consumers to find your APIs. Exchange provides a central repository for sharing and discovering your organizationâ€™s APIs. In Exchange, you can also publish best practices, templates, examples, and other types of information related to your API.

After creating an API specification in RAML, you can publish you API to Anypoint Exchange. 

After publishing your API to Anypoint Exchange, you or other users of your API can open it in Design Center or Studio

In previous versions, collaboration and feeback were accomplished using a functionality available in both Anypoint Exchange and API Manager.


== Implement an API

After the Design and Engage stages of the API lifecyle, you can implement the API specification by creating a functioning Mule application. Anypoint platform provides two different environments for implementing Mule applications:

* Anypoint Design Center: provides a web-based editor that is targetted to contributors with diverse skill sets (line-of-business, application developers).
* Anypoint Platform Studio:  provides an IDE that is fully integrated within the new API lifecycle. You can export a project from Design enter and load it in Studio.

Exchange works directly with Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio to provide a single point of access for information and assets.

After your API has been finalized, Anypoint Platform also provides tools that enable you to implement your API as a working Mule application.

|===
| Component | Description
| Design Center | Provides a web-based editor that enables you to open an API as a RAML file then add implementation details. Design Center enables you to deploy a working Mule application. Or, you can republish the Mule application to Exchange for additional collaboration.
| Anypoint Studio | 
|===

== Deploy an API

After creating and testing a functioning Mule application during the Implementation phase, you can deploy your application to Mule runtime using Anypoint Runtime Manager.

== Manage an API

After deploying your Mule application, you can also define policies that define how your API are accessed and who has access to it. You can define policies using Anypoint API Manager. You can deploy them from Anypoint Runtime Manager.

You can also manage and monitor a running application using Anypoint Runtime Manager.
