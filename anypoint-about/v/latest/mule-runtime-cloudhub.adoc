=== Mule Runtime Engine

The Mule runtime engine is the backbone of the application network. It is the runtime engine of Anypoint Platform that combines real-time application integration and orchestration with robust data integration capabilities.

The Mule runtime engine is a Java-base enterprise service bus (ESB) that can be run as a service on multiple operating systems.

=== Anypoint Connectors

Anypoint Connectors provide quick and easy connectivity to an endpoint or dynamic connectivity to API specifications. They provide the assets and tools that enable you to connect to an application or data source. MuleSoft provides pre-built connectors that enable you to connect to a variety of data sources, SaaS applications, and more. You can also build your own connectors using the Connector DevKit.

=== Runtime Services

Runtime Services enhance to core functionality of the Mule runtime engine and provide enterprise­-grade security, scalability, reliability and high availability. The following services are available:

|===
| Anypoint Fabric | Enables high availability, performance to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, and scalability to hundreds of Mule runtimes deployed in a highly distributed hybrid environment. 
| Anypoint MQ | Provides advanced asynchronous messaging scenarios such as queueing and pub/sub with fully hosted and managed cloud message queues and exchanges.
| Anypoint Enterprise Security | Provides a suite of security capabilities within the application network.
| Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud | Enables you to securely connect your corporate data centers and on-premises applications to the cloud as if they were all part of a single, private network.
| CloudHub | 
|===

== CloudHub

CloudHub is MuleSoft’s managed cloud service. It is a hosted integration-platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) where you can run Mule applications and publish APIs. CloudHub provides a fully-managed, multi-tenanted, globally available, secure and highly available cloud platform for integration applications and APIs MuleSoft manages the infrastructure for this environment, including scalability, clustering, and high-availability. 

CloudHub also provides an object store infrastructure, monitoring, troubleshooting and scheduling,

After you have designed and implemented your application or API, you can deploy it to a Mule runtime hosted on CloudHub. This makes your cloud applications publicly available and enables you to apply policies.
