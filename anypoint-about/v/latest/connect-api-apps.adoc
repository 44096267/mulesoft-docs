= About Connecting APIs and Applications

This topic describes how to uses Anypoint Connectors to connect APIs and applications. 

Anypoint connectors are a key component of the Application Network. They are extensions of the Mule runtime that enable your applications and APIs to connect to external systems such as Salesforce, Google Contacts, ServiceNow, Workday, Facebook, Twitter, MongoDB, and more. Connectors also simplify the interaction with SaaS provider APIs, including methods for many available operations.

Connectors enable you to integrate information from these systems in new contexts. When creating a Mule application, you can drag and drop a connector into the application flow. In this way, connectors save time and resources by simplifying the process of connecting your application to different, often disparate, external systems.

To create flows within a Mule application, Anypoint Platform provides the following tools.
