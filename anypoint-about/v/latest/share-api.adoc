Anypoint Exchange is a web-based application that provides a repository of Anypoint Platform components: connectors, templates, examples and APIs. You can use Anypoint Exchange to publish and manage your own components. Anypoint Exchange also enables you to discover and use proven assets built by the MuleSoft ecosystem, or add assets to a private tenant of Anypoint Exchange for collaboration and sharing of internal best practices.
