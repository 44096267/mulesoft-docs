= About Anypoint Platform Deployment Options

Anypoint Platform supports different options for how you deploy and manage the platform and its components.
Each deployment option differs primarily based on whether MuleSoft hosts and manages the underlying infrastructure of the platform or if you host and manage this infrastructure in your own environment.

The following table lists the available deployment options and shows where components of Anypoint Platform reside:
