= About Anypoint Platform Deployment Models

Anypoint Platform supports different options for how you deploy and manage the platform and its components.
Each hosting scenario differs primarily based on whether Mulesoft hosts and manages the underlying infrastructure of the platform or if you host and manage this infrastructure in your own environment.

The following table lists the available hosting scenarios and shows where components of Anypoint Platform reside:

In each hosting scenario, the user experience of managing applications and APIs is similar. See xref:feature-comp[Supported Features] for information on the Anypoint Platform components supported in each scenario.
