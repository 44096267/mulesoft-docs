= About Anypoint Platform

Anypoint Platform is a set of tools and frameworks that enable you to design, deploy and manage a network of applications, data, and devices based on API-led connectivity. It also provides the runtime environment where you deploy integration applications and expose APIs. 

== The Application Network

To understand Anypoint Platform, it is important to understand the problems it is designed to solve. The application landscape of a modern IT infrastructure is a collection of disparate applications and data sources. An organization's infrastructure can include multiple combination of SaaS applications, databases, CRM systems, and legacy systems. Designing an application that can connect to these disparate systems requires you to work with a variety of protocols, credentials, data formats, etc.

This often results in applications and data that are siloed and difficult to integrate. Additionally, when one component is down, this can cause performance bottlenecks and disruptions.

To solve this integration problem, Anypoint Platform enables you to develop an application network that seamlessly connects applications, data and devices through a common set of protocols and greatly simplifies the way those applications data and devices can talk to each other.

An application network provides a seamless network of applications, data, and devices, that can run in the cloud or in your own IT infrastructure.

== API-driven Development

To facilitate integration and connectivity between the components within the application network, Anypoint Platform supports and promotes an API-driven development model. Anypoint Platform provides tools that enable you to design and simulate the behavior of an API. It also promotes an iterative development process that enables you to gain feedback about your API.

To define an API, Anypoint Platform uses the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML). RAML is based on YAML and is both human and machine readable. This enables you to define an API without having to use a specific programming language.

== Anypoint Platform Components

To implement an application network and facilitate API-driven application development, Anypoint Platform provides tools and frameworks that enable you to design, build, deploy, and manage applications. 

The following graphic shows the major components of Anypoint Platform.

These components can be divided into two functional areas.

=== Design, Deploy, and Manage

Anypoint Platform provides applications that enable you to design, deploy, and manage applications and APIs. These applications are grouped as follows:

[autowidth.spread]
|===
| Anypoint Design Center | Provides a suite of applications that you use to design and implement applications and APIs.
| Anypoint Management Center | Provides a suite of web-based applications that you use to deploy and manage the applications and APIs you create with the Anypoint Design Center. The Anypoint Management Center also provides tools for analyzing data generated by your APIs.
| Anypoint Exchange | Anypoint Exchange is a web-based application that provides a repository of Anypoint Platform components: connectors, templates, examples and APIs.
|===


=== Mule Runtime

The runtime environment that makes these applications and APIs available to your users. The Mule runtime environment contains the following components:

|===
| Mule runtime engine | 
| Anypoint Connectors | Provide the assets and tools that enable you to connect to an application or data source. MuleSoft provides pre-built connectors that enable you to connect to a variety of data sources, SaaS applications, and more. You can also build your own connectors using the Connector DevKit.
| Runtime Services |

==== CloudHub

CloudHub is MuleSoftâ€™s managed cloud service. It is a hosted integration-platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) where you can run Mule applications and publish APIs. MuleSoft manages the infrastructure for this environment, including scalability, clustering, and high-availability. CloudHub also provides an object store infrastructure, monitoring, troubleshooting and scheduling,
