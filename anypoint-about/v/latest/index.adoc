= About Anypoint Platform and Mule Runtime

This topic provides general information about Anypoint Platform and Mule Runtime.

Anypoint Platform provides a set of tools that enable you to design, deploy and manage a network of applications, data, and devices based on API-led connectivity. Mule runtime provides a the run-time environment where you can deploy integration applications and expose APIs.

== The Application Network

The application landscape of a modern IT infrastructure is a collection of disparate applications and data sources. An organization's infrastructure can include multiple comibnation of SaaS aplications, databases, CRM systems, and legacy systems. Designing an application that can connect to these disparate systems requires you to work with a variety of protocols, credentials, data formats, etc.

This often results in applications and data that are siloed and difficult to integrate. Also, when one component is down, this can cause performance bottlenecks and disruptions.

To solve this problem, Anypoint Platform and Mule runtime provide an application network that seamlessly connects applications, data and devices through a common set of protocols and greatly simplifies the way those applications data and devices can talk to each other.
