= About Anypoint Platform

This topic provides general information about Anypoint Platform and defines the Application Network and API-driven development.

Anypoint Platform is a set of tools and frameworks that enable you to design, deploy and manage a network of applications, data, and devices based on API-led connectivity. Anypoint Platform also provides the runtime environment where you deploy integration applications and expose APIs. 

To understand Anypoint Platform, it is important to understand the problems it is designed to solve. The application landscape of a modern IT infrastructure is a collection of disparate applications and data sources. An organizational infrastructure may include multiple combination of SaaS applications, databases, CRM systems, and legacy systems. Designing an application that can connect to these disparate systems requires you to work with a variety of protocols, credentials, data formats, etc.

This often results in applications and data that are segregated and difficult to integrate. Code that you write to perform one integration task may not be reusable in another. Additionally, when one component becomes unavailable, this can cause performance bottlenecks and disruptions.

== The Application Network

To solve this integration problem, Anypoint Platform enables you to develop an application network that seamlessly connects applications, data and devices through a common set of protocols and greatly simplifies the way those applications data and devices can talk to each other.

An application network provides a seamless network of applications, data, and devices, that can run in the cloud or in your own IT infrastructure.

== API-driven Development

To facilitate integration and connectivity between the components within the application network, Anypoint Platform supports and promotes an API-driven development model. Anypoint Platform provides tools that enable you to design and simulate the behavior of an API. It also promotes an iterative development process that enables you to gain feedback about your API.

To define an API, Anypoint Platform uses the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML). RAML is based on YAML and is both human and machine readable. This enables you to define an API without having to use a specific programming language.
