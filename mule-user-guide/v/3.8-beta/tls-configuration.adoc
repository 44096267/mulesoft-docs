== The TLS Configuration Element

The TLS Configuration element is independent of any module or transport. In Mule 3.7 onwards, it's supported both by the HTTP Connector and in the Web Service Consumer.

You can create this element through the UI of the HTTP Connector's Global configuration element, on the *TLS/SSL* tab, or through the UI of the Web Service Consumer, on the *Security* tab.

In XML, the basic syntax for the element is the following:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<tls:context name="customContext">
    <tls:trust-store path="trustStore" password="mulepassword"/>
    <tls:key-store path="clientKeystore" keyPassword="mulepassword"
password="mulepassword"/>
 </tls:context>
----

[TIP]
You can include a TLS context element in a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-beta/shared-resources[domain project] so that it can be shared amongst multiple projects that are deployed to a same server.

The `tls:context` element defines a configuration for TLS, which can be used from both the client and server sides. It can be referenced by other configuration objects of other modules (or defined as a nested element of one of them).

Inside it, you can include two nested elements: `key-store` and `trust-store`. You don't need to include both, but at least one of the two must be present:

* From the server side: the trust store contains certificates of the trusted clients, the key store contains the private and public key of the server.
* From the client side: the trust store contains certificates of the trusted servers, the key store contains the private and public key of the client.

Adding a trust store or a key store to a TLS configuration implicitly implements the corresponding kind of authentication. Adding both a keystore and a trust store to one same config (as in the code example above) implicitly implements *two way TLS authentication*, also known as *mutual authentication*.

[NOTE]
The keystore may contain two passwords, as one of them can serve for accessing the entire keystore file, whilst the other (keyPassword) may be additionally needed to access the server’s private key, which is inside this file.

== Generating Keystores and Truststores

The 'tls:trust-store' and 'tls:key-store' elements must reference existing certificates. If you don't provide any values for the trust-store, default Java certificates are used. To generate your own certificates, you can do so by following the steps below using the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html[Java Keytool].

=== Generating a Keystore

. To generate a keystore that exposes your server's credentials, run the command:

+
[source, code, linenums]
----
keytool -genkey -alias serverkey -keylag RSA -keystore server.jks
----

[NOTE]
Keytool generates certificates using the DSA algorithm by default. You can instead specify it to use the RSA algorithm as in the example above through the '-keylag' argument.

. You will then be prompted for additional details, along with the store password and key password.
​
. Once this is done, you must export the server's certificate from the keystore so that it can be shared with clients. To do this, use the following command:
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
keytool -export -alias serverkey -keystore server.jks -file server_cert.cer
----

[NOTE]
There is no default Java key store in the standard JDK distribution, so you must generate your own certificates in order to use this element.

If you also wish to get signed by a Certification Authority (CA), you must export your certificate in the standard CSR format. To do so you can run this command:

[source, code, linenums]
----
keytool -certreq -keystore server.jks -alias example.com -file certificate_file
----

Here, '-file' refers to the name you wish to give to your certificate file. Once generated, send the CSR file to the CA and follow their instructions to obtain their signature.

Once you have obtained the CA's signature, you can import the signed certificate file through the following command:

[source, code, linenums]
----
keytool -import -keystore keystore -alias example.com -file signed_certificate_file
----

[NOTE]
The alias you assign when importing must not be linked to any existing key or the process will fail.


=== Generating a Trust Store

[TIP]
The standard JRE distribution includes a *default trust store* with certificates for several major certificate authorities (CA's) which is used by default in the 'tls:trust-store' element, but you can generate your own if you wish to have greater security or when using self-signed certificates.

. To create a trustStore, run the command:
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
keytool -import -alias serverkey -keystore client_truststore.ts -file server_cert.cer
----

The client will trust the server if a chain of trust can be established, either directly to the server (in case its certificate is in the trust store) or through a signing CA whose certificate is present in the trust store, failing otherwise. This means that a trust store must be defined when using self-signed certificates.



== Global TLS configuration

Besides the ability to set up trust store and key store at 'tls:context' level, you can define some other parameters at a global level for every app you deploy to Mule.

The Mule 'conf' folder includes two files that allow you to fine-tune the configuration of SSL connectors by manually setting which cipher suites and protocols Mule will use:

* 'tls-default.conf' (Allows fine-tuning when Mule is not configured to run in FIPS security mode)

* 'tls-fips140-2.conf' (Allows fine-tuning when Mule is running in FIPS security mode)

Open the relevant file and comment or uncomment items in the lists to manually configure the allowed cipher suites and SSL protocols. If you make no changes to these files, Mule allows the configured security manager to select cipher suites and protocols.

The protocol and cipher suites that you set in these configuration files is overriden by what is then set up in an individual 'tls:context' element if those parameters are defined.

[NOTE]
TLS 1.0 is no longer a valid protocol due to its significant vulnerabilites.

== Examples (for HTTPS)

=== For the HTTP Request Connector

A `request-config` element from the new HTTP connector may reference a `tls:context` element in order to implement HTTPS. If the `tls:context` is empty (no key-store or trust-store defined), then the default values of the JVM will be used, which likely already include a trust store with certificates for all the major certifying authorities.

If the client requires a certificate from the server that it is trying to connect to, then the `<tls:trust-store>` element must be added, with the path field set to the location of the trust store file that contains the certificates of the trusted servers.

If the server validates certificates from the clients, then the `<tls:key-store>` element should be also added with the path field set to the location of the keystore file that contains the private/public keys of the client.

==== Globally Defined TLS Element

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<tls:context name="clientTlsContext" >
        <tls:trust-store path="trustStoreFile" password="1234"/>
        <tls:key-store path="keyStoreFile" keyPassword="123" password="456"/>
    </tls:context>
 
    <http:request-config name="globalConfig" protocol="HTTPS" host="localhost" port="8443" tlsContext-ref="clientTlsContext" />
----

[TIP]
You can also create this element through the UI of the HTTP Connector's Global configuration element, on the *TLS/SSL* tab. Select *Use Global TLS Config*, then click the green plus sign next to *TLS Context* to create a new TLS element.

==== Nested TLS Element

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<http:request-config name="globalConfig" protocol="HTTPS" host="localhost" port="8443">
        <tls:context>
            <tls:trust-store path="trustStoreFile" password="1234"/>
            <tls:key-store path="keyStoreFile" keyPassword="123" password="456"/>
        </tls:context>
    </http:request-config>
----

[TIP]
You can also create this element through the UI of the HTTP Connector's Global configuration element, on the *TLS/SSL* tab. Select *Use TLS Config*, then provide values for the fields presented there to set up the trust store and/or the key store.

=== For the HTTP Listener Connector

A listener-config element from the new HTTP connector may reference a `tls:context` element in order to configure HTTPS. In this case, the `tls:context` is required to at least contain a `tls:key-store` element, with the path field set to the location of the keystore file that contains the private/public keys of the server.

If the server needs to validate certificates from clients, then a `tls:trust-store` element should also be added, with the path field set to the location of the trust store file that contains the certificates of the trusted clients.

==== Globally Defined TLS Element

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<tls:context name="serverTlsContext" >
        <tls:trust-store path="trustStoreFile" password="1234"/>
        <tls:key-store path="keyStoreFile" keyPassword="123" password="456"/>
    </tls:context>
 
    <http:listener-config name="globalConfig" protocol="HTTPS" host="localhost" port="8443" tlsContext-ref="serverTlsContext" />
----

[TIP]
You can also create this element through the UI of the HTTP Connector's Global configuration element, on the *TLS/SSL* tab. Select *Use Global TLS Config*, then click the green plus sign next to *TLS Context* to create a new TLS element.

==== Nested TLS Element

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="globalConfig" protocol="HTTPS" host="localhost" port="8443">
        <tls:context>
            <tls:trust-store path="trustStoreFile" password="1234"/>
            <tls:key-store path="keyStoreFile" keyPassword="123" password="456"/>
        </tls:context>
    </http:listener>
----

[TIP]
====
You can also create this element through the UI of the HTTP Connector's Global configuration element, on the *TLS/SSL* tab. Select *Use TLS Config*, then provide values for the fields presented there to set up the trust store and/or the key store.
====

[TIP]
====
If you're using the HTTP Connector for a 2-way TLS authenticated connection, the client certificate is exposed using the inbound property `http.client.cert`.

You can access the client principal through: `inboundProperties['http.client.cert'].getSubjectDN()`

== Attributes of the tls-context Element

[width"99a",cols="10a,80a,10a"]
|===
|*Attribute* |*Description* |*Required*
|enabledProtocols| Overrides the protocols set in the <<Global TLS configuration>> |Optional

[TIP]
====
Cipher Suite names can be very lengthy, which can have an impact in the readability of your XML code. To keep things neater, you can instead keep your Cipher Suite names in an external properties file in your Mule project and refer to it.
