== Overview

Anypoint MQ (AMQ) is a multi-tenant, cloud messaging service designed to enable customers to perform advanced asynchronous messaging scenarios between their applications. AMQ is fully integrated with Anypoint Platform, offering role based access control, client application management, and connectors.

AMQ is a pub/sub and point-to-point messaging broker that handles messages between:

* Applications running on premises and applications in the Anypoint Resource Manager (ARM).
* Applications running on CloudHub or in Anypoint API Gateway.

AMQ works with Anypoint Studio using the MQ Connector to send and receive messages.

Receiver applications register with AMQ to receive messages. Notification events trigger when a message arrives in AMQ.

=== Features

* *Queues and Exchanges*: Send messages to queues, pull messages from queues, create a message exchange to perform pub/sub scenarios and send a message to multiple queues.
Management console: monitor queue statistics, purge queues, and see how many messages are in flight via the management console.
* *Anypoint MQ connector*: Send/receive messages from any Mule application, whether it’s deployed in CloudHub or used in a hybrid scenario and deployed on-premises.
* *REST API*: Use the REST API to easily communicate with non-Mule applications.
Environments and role based access control: Anypoint MQ is fully integrated with Anypoint Access Management, allowing you to specify different environments for your queues, who can access each environment, and what they can do within each environment.
* *Client management*: Create client applications tokens
* *Large payloads*: Anypoint MQ supports payloads up to 10 MB in size.
* *Multi-region* (GA only): Ensure data-locality by creating queues in specific regions. For GA, we provide US East, Ireland, and Sydney. We are adding additional regions shortly thereafter.
* *Disaster recovery and multi-data center availability*: Anypoint MQ provides persistent data storage across multiple data centers, ensuring that it can handle data center outages and have full disaster recovery.
* *Encrypted queues*: queue data can optionally be encrypted, ensuring that companies can be compliant with their data at rest policies.

=== Use Case

An example of AMQ would be where an application running Salesforce customer relationship manager (CRM) wants to communicate with two applications that handle different databases.

Using AMQ, the Salesforce application sends a pub/sub message to the AMQ message exchange, and the two applications receive the message from the message exchange and convey the message to their respective databases.

=== Definitions

AMQ provides these core concepts:

* *Ack/Nack*: *Ack* - An application receives a message and MQ deletes the message. 
*Nack* - An application does not receive a message and MQ does not delete the message.

|1. Requests message |2. Sends message and lock ID
|3. Modifies TTL if needed |
|4. Acks and receives message, or nacks and leaves message in MQ |

* *Binding* - Lets pub/sub applications bridge the simple pub/sub structure and utilize point-to-point features such as sending a message to specific applications. Bindings identify which queues comprise an exchange. In Anypoint Platform, by specifying which message queues are in an exchange, Anypoint MQ creates and manages the bindings for you.
* *Destination* - A middleware software component to which applications register to provide or receive messages, a storage area where messages are sent to, and from where an application receives a message. In Anypoint Studio, the destination is configured from the Anypoint MQ Connector.
* *Durable message* - A message that persists until its indicated client receives it.
* *Message* - Serializable link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/mule-message-structure[Mule Message] content that applications send and receive, so that the applications can communicate with each other.
* *Message Exchange* - A pub/sub message source with multiple outputs. Applications register to subscribe to messages that the exchange publishes.
* *Point-to-point* - A pattern that allows an application to send a message that only a single application can receive.
* *Pub/sub* (publish/subscribe) - A ​pattern that allows messages to be distributed to multiple consumers.
* *Publisher* - Applications that send messages to Anypoint MQ.
* *Queue* - A point-to-point message storage area that holds a message that a client receives.
* *Subscriber* - Applications that receive messages from Anypoint MQ.

== Creating Queues

You can use Anypoint Platform to create queues and exchanges.

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *MQ* in the taskbar:
+
image:mq-in-taskbar.png[MQ appears in the upper AP taskbar]
+
. Click the blue plus circle and click *Queue* from the drop-down menu:
+
image:mq-click-queue.png[Click the Queue option from the blue circle menu]
+
. In the *Create Queues* window, provide a queue name, and if needed, change the time-to-live values for how long a message persists before being automatically deleted, and how long you can apply a lock to a message so that an application has exclusive access to the message. If needed, mark the queue so that any messages that arrive in the queue get encrypted using MD5. To mark the queue, slide the Encryption slider to the right.

+
. Click *Save Changes*.

== Queue Details

Review the destination details screen:

image:mq-queue-details.png[Queue Details to the right of the queue entry]

You can use the details display to:

* Purge messages
* Delete a queue
* View queued messages
* View in-flight messages
* View exchanges to which the queue is bound

== Create a Message Exchange

A message exchange is made up of one or more queues that are bound to the exchange.

. Click the blue plus circle and click *Exchange*:
+
image:mq-click-exchange.png[From the blue circle drop down click Exchange]
+
In the *Create Exchange* window, provide an exchange name, and click which queues to bind to the exchange. If needed, mark the exchange so that any messages that arrive in each queue gets encrypted (using MD5). To mark the exchange, slide the Encryption slider to the right.
+

+
. Click *Save Changes*.

== Message Exchange Details

The message exchange details appear to the right of the exchange entry:

image:mq-exchange-details.png[Exchange details to the right of the entry]

You can use the details display to:

* Delete the exchange
* Monitor exchange throughput
* View which queues are bound to the exchange

== Anypoint Studio MQ Connector

To add the MQ connector to Studio:

. In Studio, click *Help* > *Install New Software*.
. Next to the *Works with* field, click *Add*.
.. Set the name to `Incubator` and the URL to: +
+
`http://s3.amazonaws.com/mule-tooling-incubator/lanin`
+
. Follow the prompts to install the software.
. Open the `conf.properties` file in `src/main/resources` and specify the
`client.id` and `client.secret` properties. Copy the ID and Secret from the client you created.


=== Example Studio Flow

Create a new Mule Project and copy the following to the XML editor view of Studio.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mq:config name="Anypoint_MQ_Configuration" doc:name="Anypoint MQ Configuration">
       <mq:access brokerUrl="${url}" clientId="${client.id}" clientSecret="${client.secret}"/>
   </mq:config>
   <flow name="producerFlow">
       <poll doc:name="Poll">
           <dw:transform-message doc:name="Create Customer">
               <dw:set-payload><![CDATA[%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
{
    "firstName" : "Joe",
    "lastName" : "Schmoe",
    "company" : "Acme, Inc"
}]]></dw:set-payload>
           </dw:transform-message>
       </poll>
       <mq:publish config-ref="Anypoint_MQ_Configuration" destination="customer-updates" doc:name="Anypoint MQ"/>
   </flow>
