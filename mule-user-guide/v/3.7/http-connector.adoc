= HTTP Connector
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connectors, http, https, http headers, query parameters, rest, raml

The HTTP Connector can send an receive HTTP and HTTPS requests over a selected host, port and address.

Depending on which type of HTTP connector you use, you can either:

* link:/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Listener+Connector[Listen for HTTP requests] that arrive at a certain address and provide an HTTP response to these
* link:/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Request+Connector[Send HTTP requests] to a certain address and receive the returned response

Through additional configuration, the connector allows you to:

* Use link:/documentation/display/current/TLS+Configuration[TLS] encryption to send or receive *HTTPS* requests 
* Send link:/documentation/display/current/Authentication+in+HTTP+Requests[Authenticated Requests], through *Basic Authentication, Digest and OAuth*

In Studio, the HTTP Connector can work in one of two ways, depending on where it's placed on a flow:

* As an link:/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Listener+Connector[HTTP Listener Connector]
* As an link:/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Request+Connector[HTTP Request Connector]

To instance the connector as an HTTP Listener Connector, you must place it into the *Source* section of a flow (ie: as the first element in the flow):

image:add+listener.png[add+listener]

To instance the connector as an HTTP Request Connector, you must place it into the *Process* section of a flow (ie: anywhere except the beginning of it):

image:add+request+connector.png[add+request+connector]

When writing Mule projects in XML, the HTTP Connector can work in one of two ways, depending on how you create it:

* As an link:/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Listener+Connector[HTTP Listener Connector]
* As an link:/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Request+Connector[HTTP Request Connector]

To instance the connector as an HTTP Listener Connector, add the following XML tag at the start of a flow:

`<``http:listener` `config-ref``=``"HTTP_Listener_Configuration"` `path``=``"/"``/>`

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:

`<http:listener-config` `name``=``"HTTP_Listener_Configuration"` `host``=``"localhost"` `port``=``"8081"``/>`

To instance the connector as an HTTP Listener Connector, add the following XML tag in any part of a flow:

 `<``http:request` `config-ref``=``"HTTP_Request_Configuration"` `path``=``"/"` `method``=``"GET"``/>`

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:


[source,xml, linenums]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Configuration" host="example.com" port="8081"/>

[TIP]
To migrate a project that users instances of the old http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Transport+Reference[HTTP endpoint-based Connector] to the new HTTP operation-based Connector, see link:/documentation/display/current/Migrating+to+the+New+HTTP+Connector[Migrating to the New HTTP Connector]. The old HTTP endpoint-based Connector still does work with Mule 3.6 Runtime, but it's deprecated and will be eventually removed.

[TIP]
You can edit the log4j2 configuration file to make the logging of the HTTP connector's activity a lot more verbose, if you need to. See link:/documentation/display/current/Logging+in+Mule[Logging in Mule] for instructions.
