This document walks you step by step through some basic transformations you can easily do with the Transform Message element in Anypoint Studio.

For more advanced examples, see link:/docs/display/current/DataWeave+Examples[DataWeave Examples].

== One to one JSON to XML Conversion

Suppose you want to transform any JSON payload to XML, retaining the original data structure regardless of what attributes and nested objects or arrays the input might contain.

To achieve this, follow the steps below:

. Drag an HTTP Connector into a new flow, create a new global element for it by clicking the green plus sign in its properties editor. Set its host to `localhost` and leave its port as the default `8081`, then click Ok. Back in the properties editor of the connector, set the path to `ex1`.
. Drag a *Transform Message* Transformer to your flow, right after your HTTP Connector, then open its properties editor.

+

. You will see that the properties editor is divided into three sections: on the left the input, on the right the output, and in the middle is where you write your DataWeave code. Note that a basic scaffolding for your code is automatically provided, as no metadata is available about the input or the output, the scaffolding is very basic in this case.

+
image:/docs/download/attachments/132351219/new+weave.png?version=1&modificationDate=1436393596399[image]

. In the transform section of the editor, change the DataWeave code so that it looks like this:
+

[source, ruby, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/xml
---
payload
----
+

The directives in the Header of this transform define the output as being of type XML.
The body of this transform simply references the payload, which is implicitly an input directive of this transform, as are all of the components of the inbound Mule message. Whatever exists in the payload – including any child elements at any depth – is transformed directly into XML without changing any of its structure.
+
. Try the transformer out: In the Input section of the editor, select the "payload" element, then click the pencil icon on the top to provide a sample input for it. Notice that a new "payload" tab appears, write or paste any example JSON input here. 
+

image:/docs/download/attachments/132351219/input.png?version=1&modificationDate=1436393596372[image]

. In the output section, select the *Preview* tab. Notice how this tab shows you the resulting output as an XML structure, and updates it in real time as you make changes.
+

image:/docs/download/attachments/132351219/tut12.png?version=1&modificationDate=1436393596425[image]

. Currently, you must provide an example input for your transformation to work, this behavior will be changed with the official release of this transformer. In this example, the structure of your example JSON input doesn't need to match the real input that the transformer will receive at runtime.
Try pasting this:
+

[source, json, linenums]
----
{"abc":
    {
    "cba":"ddd",
    "ccc":"eee",
    "aaa":["fgh","ghf","hgf"]
    }
}
----
+

. Save your Mule project and Deploy it to Studio's virtual server to try it out by right-clicking on the project and selecting `Run As -> Mule Application`.
. Using a tool like Postman (chrome extension), send an HTTP POST request to http://localhost:8081/ex1 with any JSON content you want in the request body. You should get a response with an XML body that has the same data and structure as the input. +
For example, if you send a request with this body:

[source, json, linenums]
----
{"ccc":
    {
    "ddd":"ddd",
    "eee":"eee",
    "fff":["fgh","ghf","hgf"]
    }
}
----

You should get this in the body of the response:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<ccc>
  <ddd>ddd</ddd>
  <eee>eee</eee>
  <fff>
    <element>fgh</element>
    <element>ghf</element>
    <element>hgf</element>
  </fff>
</ccc>

== Renaming Fields and Calculating Expressions

In this example, the data you get as an input is not only in a different format from what you need, you also need to pick out only a couple of the values in it, rename them and even infer some values from others.

Suppose that you want to send a SOAP request to a web service that makes money conversions from one currency to another, based on information you get from a sales tracking software you use that outputs data in a different structure. The external service needs a JSON input with values for the following set of keys:

* size
* email
* name
* address1
* address2
* city
* stateOrProvince
* postalCode
* country

In this example, imagine that the output that you get from your sales tracking software follows the structure of this sample JSON file:

[source, json, linenums]
----
{
    "product":{
        "price": "5",
        "model": "Mulesoft Connect 2015"
    },
    "item_amount": "3",
    "payment":{
         "payment-type": "credit-card",
         "currency": "USD",
         "installments": "1"
    },
    "buyer":{
        "email":"mike@hotmail.com",
        "name":"Michael",
        "address":"Koala Boulevard 314",
        "city":"San Diego",
        "state":"CA",
        "postCode":"1345",
        "nationality":"USA"
    },
 "shop": "main branch",
    "salesperson": "Mathew Chow"
}
----

. Download the above example link:/docs/download/attachments/132351219/example.json?version=2&modificationDate=1437498430407[as a file.]
. Drag an HTTP Connector into a new flow, select the connector configuration that you created for the previous example. Set the path of the connector to `ex2`
. Select the *Metadata* tab in the HTTP Connector, then click *Add Metadata*. Select the **Output:Payload**, then click the edit icon next to it.
+

image:/docs/download/attachments/132351219/add+metadata.png?version=1&modificationDate=1437401503192[image]

. Select the *Create new type* radio button at the top, pick the type *JSON*, assign it any ID you wish, and then indicate the route to the JSON example you just downloaded above.
. Note that while the HTTP Connector is selected in your canvas, the output tab of the metadata explorer should now show the fields that will be present in the outgoing payload.
+

image:/docs/download/thumbnails/132351219/ex2output.png?version=1&modificationDate=1437499558746[image]
+

. Drag a link:/docs/display/current/Web+Service+Consumer[Web Service Consumer] to your flow. Create a global configuration for it by clicking the green plus sign in its properties editor. In the *WSDL Location* field, paste the following URL: **http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl**.  Note that all of the other fields in the configuration element are completed automatically when you do this. Then click *Ok*.
. Back in the Web Service Consumer's properties editor, select *OrderTshirt* in the *Operation* field. Note that while the Web Service Consumer element is selected in your canvas, the metadata explorer should now show the set of fields that are expected in the payload as inputs.
+

image:/docs/download/thumbnails/132351219/ex2inputexpected.png?version=1&modificationDate=1437499739741[image]
+

[TIP]
====
You may need to click away from the Web Service Consumer after making these changes for the metadata to be updated.
====
+

. Drag a Transform Message element  in between the HTTP connector and the Web Service Consumer.
+

image:/docs/download/attachments/132351219/ex2+flow.png?version=1&modificationDate=1436393596349[image]

. Note that, as this time there's metadata available in the flow the Transform Message element builds a complete scaffolding for your code with placeholders for everything that needs to be in the output:
+

[source, ruby, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/xml
%namespace ns0 http://mulesoft.org/tshirt-service
---
{
    ns0#OrderTshirt: {
        size: "????",
        email: "????",
        name: "????",
        address1: "????",
        address2: "????",
        city: "????",
        stateOrProvince: "????",
        postalCode: "????",
        country: "????"
    }
}
----
+

The expected output of the transform is an XML with a specific set of values. The scaffolding that DataWeave builds already provides string literals as placeholders in each of these and sets the output format to the corresponding type.

. As this time there's metadata about the data coming into the Transform Message element, note that if you select the *Payload* in the input section and click the *edit icon* at the top, the new payload tab that opens up already shows a sample input built from the JSON example you provided the HTTP Connector:
+

[source, json, linenums]
----
{
  "product": {
  "price": "????",
  "model": "????"
},
  "item_amount": "????",
  "payment": {
  "payment-type": "????",
  "currency": "????",
  "installments": "????"
},
  "buyer": {
  "email": "????",
  "name": "????",
  "address": "????",
  "city": "????",
  "state": "????",
  "postCode": "????",
  "nationality": "????"
},
  "shop": "????",
  "salesperson": "????"
}
----
+

This sample input will be used to build a sample output, however, as the body of your DataWeave code doesn't refer to any elements in it yet, you still won't see anything changing in the output if you edit it now.

+
image:/docs/download/attachments/132351219/initial+full+dw.png?version=1&modificationDate=1437500165185[image]

. Edit the provided DataWeave scaffolding to fill in the placeholders for the required output fields with references to your input:
+

[source, ruby, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/xml
%namespace ns0 http://mulesoft.org/tshirt-service
---
{
    ns0#OrderTshirt: {
        size: "M",
        email: payload.buyer.email,
        name: payload.buyer.name,
        address1: payload.buyer.address,
        address2: "????",
        city: payload.buyer.city,
        stateOrProvince: payload.buyer.state,
        postalCode: payload.buyer.postCode,
        country: payload.buyer.nationality
    }
}
----
+

In the code above, the fields are mostly populated with references to elements in the payload, these are often found a few levels within the data structure, so you need to drill down to it using the *.* selector. As there's no data for the shirt size in the coming input, we provide a literal expression "M".

. We can make this a little more interesting by changing the literal expression that populates "size" into a conditional expression. See how the line that defines "size" has changed, it sets it to "M" unless the buyer's state is Texas, then it makes the shirt "XXL".
+

[source, ruby, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/xml
%namespace ns0 http://mulesoft.org/tshirt-service
---
{
    ns0#OrderTshirt: {
        size: "M" unless payload.buyer.state == "TX" otherwise size: "XXL",
        email: payload.buyer.email,
        name: payload.buyer.name,
        address1: payload.buyer.address,
        address2: "????",
        city: payload.buyer.city,
        stateOrProvince: payload.buyer.state,
        postalCode: payload.buyer.postCode,
        country: payload.buyer.nationality
    }
}
----
+

. Note how now, if you replace the placeholders in the input section for actual values, these will be populated into the values of the preview in the output section, giving you a tangible representation of what the final result will be. Try populating the "state" field in the input sample with TX and note how the "size" field in the output sample is updated in real time.
. Save your Mule project and Deploy it to Studio's virtual server to try it out by right-clicking on the project and selecting `Run As -> Mule Application`.
. Using a tool like Postman (chrome extension), send an HTTP POST request to http://localhost:8081/ex2 with a JSON body like the one below:

[source, json, linenums]
----
{
    "product":{
        "price": "5",
        "model": "Mulesoft Connect 2015"
    },
    "item_amount": "3",
    "payment":{
         "payment-type": "credit-card",
         "currency": "USD",
         "installments": "1"
    },
    "buyer":{
        "email":"mike@hotmail.com",
        "name":"Michael",
        "address":"Koala Boulevard 314",
        "city":"San Diego",
        "state":"CA",
        "postCode":"1345",
        "nationality":"USA"
    },
 "shop": "main branch",
    "salesperson": "Mathew Chow"
}
----

You should get a response with an XML body that has a single value, this is the order ID for the shirt order you just placed.

== Rearranging your Input

. Drag an HTTP Connector into a new flow, select the connector configuration that you created for the previous example. Set the path of the connector to `ex3`
. Drag a Salesforce Connector into your flow, after the HTTP Connector. Create a global configuration for it by clicking the green plus sign in its properties editor. If you own a Salesforce account, fill in your Salesforce Username, password and security token (which you should be able to find in the email you got from Salesforce when you first registered). Click *Test Connection* to make sure your credentials are accepted, then click *ok*. +
Back in the properties editor of the Salesforce connector, select the operation *Query*. In the *Query Text* field below, write the following simple query:
+

[source, sql, linenums]
----
SELECT Name, Email, Id, Title  FROM Contact
----

+
This will retrieve every one of the contacts linked to your Salesforce account, each of them with four fields of data. +
Notice how now – while the Salesfoce connector is selected in your canvas – the metadata explorer's *Out* tab shows that the output payload contains a list of contacts, each with these four fields. If it doesn't, you may need to click the *Refresh metadata* button under the metada explorer.
+

image:/docs/download/thumbnails/132351219/ex3+metadata.png?version=1&modificationDate=1436393596364[image]

. Add a Transform Message element to your flow after the Salesforce connector, open its properties editor.
+

image:/docs/download/attachments/132351219/ex3+flow.png?version=1&modificationDate=1436393596357[image]

. Note that in the input section of the editor, there already is an additional *Payload* tab that shows a sample input with placeholders for its fields. As the type of the input is a POJO, the object is displayed as described through a DataWeave transform:
+

[source, ruby, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
[{
    Name: "????",
    Email: "????",
    Id: "????",
    Title: "????"
}]
----
+

This sample gives you a clear reference of how the incoming data is structured and how you can reference each value. This sample input is also used to produce a sample output in the output section. Flesh it out to make it into more helpful data, for example paste this in its place:
+

[source, ruby, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
[{
    Name: "Mr White",
    Email: "white@mulesoft.com",
    Id: "1234",
    Title: "Chief Java Prophet"
},
{
    Name: "Mr Orange",
    Email: "orange@mulesoft.com",
    Id: "4567",
    Title: "Integration Ninja"
},
{
    Name: "Mr Pink",
    Email: "pink@mulesoft.com",
    Id: "8923",
    Title: "Integration Ninja"
},
{
    Name: "Mr Blue",
    Email: "blue@mulesoft.com",
    Id: "8923",
    Title: "Executive Growth Rockstar Ambassador"
}
]
----

. As in the previous case, there's already a scaffolding for your DataWeave code in the transform section. As there's no metadata about the desired output, there isn't anything specified in the body yet. Change the output directive from the default `application/java` to `application/json`.
. In the transform section, Write the following DataWeave code:
+

[source, ruby, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
roles: payload groupBy $.Title
----

+
The output you're creating is an object. When objects have a single element, there's no need to wrap it in curly brackets, as is necessary when it has multiple elements. This top level object with a single element in it named "roles" which in turn holds an object that contains everything else. Its contents are gouped by the "$.Title" field, which is an expression evaluated in the context of every contact in the input array. The output section of the editor should display this:
+

[source, json, linenums]
----
{
  "roles": {
    "Chief Java Prophet": [
      {
        "Name": "Mr White",
        "Email": "white@mulesoft.com",
        "Id": "1234",
        "Title": "Chief Java Prophet"
      }
    ],
    "Executive Growth Rockstar Ambassador": [
      {
        "Name": "Mr Blue",
        "Email": "blue@mulesoft.com",
        "Id": "8923",
        "Title": "Executive Growth Rockstar Ambassador"
      }
    ],
    "Integration Ninja": [
      {
        "Name": "Mr Orange",
        "Email": "orange@mulesoft.com",
        "Id": "4567",
        "Title": "Integration Ninja"
      },
      {
        "Name": "Mr Pink",
        "Email": "pink@mulesoft.com",
        "Id": "8923",
        "Title": "Integration Ninja"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
+

Each different available value for "title" will have a corresponding element inside the "roles" object, each holding an array of objects with every contact that matches that value for title.
. Save your Mule project and Deploy it to Studio's virtual server to try it out by right-clicking on the project and selecting `Run As -> Mule Application`.
. Using any browser you want, make a request to http://localhost:8081/ex3. You should get a response with an JSON body that contains a top level object, and inside it the object "roles" that has each different title as an element, each of these containing an array of objects with each contact in your Salesforce Account that matches its title.
