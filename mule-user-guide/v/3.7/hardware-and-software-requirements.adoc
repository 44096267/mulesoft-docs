:keywords: esb, mule, requirements, os, jdk, installation, jre

This page lists the hardware, operating systems, Java, and other requirements to run Mule ESB, API Gateway, Mule Management Console, Anypoint Studio, and Anypoint Studio as Eclipse Plug-in.

== Mule ESB

[cols=",",options="header"]
|===
2+|*Hardware Requirements:* footnote:[This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM Mule needs).]
|
a|* 2GHz, dual-core CPU, or 2 virtual CPUs in virtualized environments
* 2GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage
2+|*Software Requirements* footnote:[Because the only mandatory requirement for Mule ESB is Java, Mule ESB should also run on any later versions of the tested operating systems in the above list, as well as any other operating systems supported by the JREs.]

=== Run MMC as a Web Application

Mule Management Console should be run as a web application deployed on a web container such as JBoss or Tomcat, and NOT as a Mule application. We recommend configuring the web application server's memory areas with the following minimum sizes:

*  Heap: 2GB (3GB recommended) 
*  Permanent Generation: 512MB
