= MUnit 1.0-RC Migration Guide
:keywords: mule, esb, tests, qa, quality assurance, verify, functional testing, unit testing, stress testing

MUnit 1.0-RC introduces changes to the syntax, aimed at providing a simpler and more consistent user experience than the Beta version. When upgrading to 1.0-RC, you will need to update your tests to conform to the new syntax.

The major change in 1.0-RC is to simplify how assertions and mocks specify values. Previously, attributes were of the form `value-ref`. If a string was supplied, it referenced a bean in the Spring registry. In 1.0-RC, the literal value of an attribute will be the actual value expected. 

If you need to lookup a Spring bean for comparison, you can look it up using a MEL function:

[source]
----
getBeanFromMuleContext(‘bean_name’)
----

If the bean is not found, it will return null.
