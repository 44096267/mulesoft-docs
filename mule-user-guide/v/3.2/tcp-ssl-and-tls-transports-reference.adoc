= TCP, SSL, and TLS Transports Reference

There are two Mule transports that provide access to TCP connections:

The link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/TCP+Transport+Reference[TCP Transport], which uses the basic TCP transport. +
The link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/SSL+and+TLS+Transports+Reference[SSL and TLS Transports], which use TCP with socket-level security. (SSL and TLS are actually two names for the same transport.)

Other than the type of socket used, these transports all behave quite similarly.
