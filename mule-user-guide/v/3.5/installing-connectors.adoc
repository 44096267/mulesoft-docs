= Installing Connectors

This page explains how to install connectors, uninstall connectors, and work with connector dependencies in both Anypoint(TM) Studio and Maven.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the information on this page applies to operation-based connectors only. All endpoint-based connectors are bundled automatically with Anypoint Studio and cannot be installed or updated individually via an update site.

If you don't use Studio, you can specify endpoint-based connectors as required transports when you generate a project using the [Maven mule-project-archetype].

== Installing Connectors

Beyond those included with the out-of-the-box version of Anypoint Studio, there are many more *Anypoint(TM) Connectors* you can download and use in your Mule applications to connect to third-party APIs. If you want to add your catalog of connectors, you can download many more from the *Connector Update Site*. If you don't use Anypoint Studio, you can install the appropriate Maven dependencies into your `pom.xml` file.

== Dependencies

*Automatic Dependency Management*

In an Anypoint Studio project that does _not_ include Maven support, when you add a connector to your flow, Studio automatically adds all of its dependencies (including `.jar` files) to your project's [classpath]. Mule manages each connector's dependencies as an Eclipse user library. Because Studio adds a connector's dependencies to your project's classpath, you can reference connector classes within other projects in your Anypoint Studio instance.

In an Anypoint Studio project that is built with Maven support, when you add a connector to your flow, Studio automatically adds the dependency (and the inclusion element to the maven-mule-plugin, if needed) to your pom file. Then, it refreshes your project dependencies based on the new contents of your pom file, and the connector (and its transitive dependencies) will appear referenced in your project's "Referenced Libraries" section as a set of references to `.jar` files in your local m2 repository.

Refer to [Deploying Mule Applications] for more information on managing your user libraries in Studio.

*Manually Adding Connector Dependencies*

Complete the following procedures to manually add connector dependencies to your project's classpath in Studio.

. In the *Package Explorer* pane, right-click on your project's name, then select *Build Path > Add Libraries*.

. In the *Add Libraries* wizard, select *Anypoint Connector Dependencies*, then click *Next*.

. Check the boxes associated with the connector dependencies you wish to add to your project's classpath.
+

. Click *Finish* to add the dependencies.
....
[tab,title="Maven"]
....
If you are installing a connector as a Maven dependency, ensure that you complete the following three steps for each connector:

. To make any connector module available to a Mavenized Mule application, first add the following repositories to you `pom.xml` file:
+
[source]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>mulesoft-releases</id>
        <name>MuleSoft Repository</name>
        <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/releases/</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
    <repository>
        <id>mulesoft-snapshots</id>
        <name>MuleSoft Snapshot Repository</name>
        <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/snapshots/</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

. Then add the module as a dependency to your project, replacing `insert-artifcactID-here` with the artifactID of the specfic module you are adding and replacing RELEASE with the version of this module.
+
[source]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
    <artifactId>insert-artifactId-here</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

. If you plan to use this module inside a Mule application, you need to add it to the packaging process. As such, the final zip file which will contain your flows and Java code will also contain this module and its dependencies. Add a special inclusion to the configuration of the Mule-Maven plugin for this module, replacing `insert-artifactID-here` with the artifactID of the specific module you are adding.
+
[source]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.mule.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-mule-plugin</artifactId>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <excludeMuleDependencies>false</excludeMuleDependencies>
        <inclusions>
            <inclusion>
                <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
                <artifactId>insert-artifactId-here</artifactId>
            </inclusion>
        </inclusions>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
