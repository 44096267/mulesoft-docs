= Deploying an Application

With a Mule cluster up and running, we can deploy an application to run on the cluster. The *Mule HA Demo Bundle* includes a *cluster-demo-app* that we shall deploy to the cluster.

. On the management console, click the *Applications* tab, then click *New*.

. In the *Deployment Name* filed, enter a unique name for the deployment, such as `Demo App 456`.
. Click the *Upload New Application* button.
. In the pop-up dialogue (see image below), click *Browse*, then navigate to `mule-ha-bundle-2.0>apps>cluster-demo-app.zip`. Select the `.zip` file, then click *Add* to upload the application to the management console (see image below, bottom).
