= Exception Filter

*Purpose:* Filters messages according to the type of an exception.

*Minimum Configuration:* The class that indicates the type of the exception.

*Discussion:* An Exception Filter matches on the type of an exception. You supply the class indicating the exception type to the Expected Type property. For example, for a runtime exception type, you might set Expected Type to `java.lang.RuntimeException`. You can enter the class name or browse to it.
