= Configuring Security

Mule ESB allows you to authenticate requests via endpoints using transport-specific or generic authentication methods. It also allows you to control method-level authorization on yourÂ components. The Security Manager is responsible for authenticating requests based on one or more security providers. All security is pluggable via the http://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/current/apidocs/org/mule/api/security/package-summary.html[Mule security API], so you can easily plug in custom implementations.

For information on the elements you can configure for the Security Manager, see link:/docs/display/34X/Security+Manager+Configuration+Reference[Security Manager Configuration Reference]. The following sections provide links to information on configuring different types of security managers.

== WS-Security and SAML

WS-Security is a standard protocol for applying security to Web services. It contains specifications on how integrity and confidentiality in a SOAP message can be enforced via XML signatures and binary security tokens such as X.509 certificates and Kerberos tickets as well as encryption headers. It ensures end-to-end security by working in the application layer as opposed to the transport layer. Mule provides the following resources for WS-Security:

* link:/docs/display/34X/Enabling+WS-Security[Enabling WS-Security] - Describes how to secure your CXF SOAP endpoints with WS-Security.
* link:/docs/display/34X/SAML+Module[SAML Module] - Mule now supports the SAML standard for exchange of security information between systems. This module is available in the enterprise edition of Mule as of version 2.2.3

== Other Security Integration

Mule also supports the following security technologies:

* link:/docs/display/34X/Encryption+Strategies[Encryption Strategies] - Secure your messages by encrypting them.
* link:/docs/display/34X/PGP+Security[PGP Security] - Secure your messages by encrypting them with PGP.
* link:/docs/display/34X/Jaas+Security[Jaas Security]
