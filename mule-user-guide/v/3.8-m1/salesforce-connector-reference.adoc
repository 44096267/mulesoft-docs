= Salesforce Connector Reference
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connector, endpoint, salesforce

The Salesforce Connector enacts API calls targeting Salesforce's SOAP API, REST API, Bulk API, or Streaming API, depending on the operation that you configure. The connector's API calls to Salesforce use an XML request/response over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are abstracted from the user and built into the connector.
