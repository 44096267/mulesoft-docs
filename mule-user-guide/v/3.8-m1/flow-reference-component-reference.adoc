= Flow Reference Component Reference
:keywords: flow reference, async, asynchronous, parallel processes

Use a *Flow Reference* component in a flow to direct Mule to send a message to another flow for processing. When a message reaches a flow reference component in a flow, Mule sends the message to another flow according to the configuration of the `flow-ref` attributes.

[NOTE]
When Mule passes a message to another flow via a flow reference, the message is not carried via a transport. Thus, any outbound properties on the message remain outbound properties rather than being converted into inbound properties (as they would be if the message crossed the transport barrier.)

A flow reference can route messages to any type of flow within the same application. Refer to link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8-m1/flows-and-subflows[Flows and Subflows] for more information.

== Configuration
