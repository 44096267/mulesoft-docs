= To Batch-Write to a File

In this procedure, a database connector retrieves data from two tables. Mule feeds this data into Transform Message inside the Batch Commit. In Transform Message, DataWeave maps the data from Java.util.HashMap to the CSV format. A file connector writes the resulting CSV file to disk, and a logger component logs processing details to the console. 

This procedure uses a MySQL sample database, which you can import. Download the SQL script using the following URL:

`+https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/_attachments/create.sample.db.sql+`

The script creates the database that has tables named employees and roles. 

. In Studio, create a new project, and drag connectors onto the canvas as follows:
+
* Drag Poll onto the canvas.
* Put Database inside Poll in the _input_ section.
* Put Batch Commit inside Batch Step.
* Put Transform and File inside Batch Commit in the _process_ section of Batch Step.
* Put Logger in the _on complete_ section of Batch Step, as shown in the following screenshot:
+

+
. In Database properties, click Add image:Add-16x16.png[add], and set the following options:
* Host: The name of the host running MySQL.
* Port: *3306*
* User and Password: Your database user name and password.
* Database: *company*
* MySQL Driver: Browse to and select the driver on your file system that is compatible with your database.
+
Test and save the settings.
+
. In Database properties, set options according to the following table:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Value
|*Operation* |`Select`
|*Query Type* |`Parameterized`
|*Parameterized SQL Statement* |`SELECT no, first_name, last_name, role FROM employees INNER JOIN roles ON employees.no = roles.emp_no`
|===
+
. Double-click Transform Message to open its configuration.
+
Datasense should build the input side of your transform. If this is not the case, define the metadata as *Map*, comprised of *List<Element>*, adding the attributes and their types per the database table attributes. To instruct DataWeave how to process the MySQL data, right-click Payload on the left and click Set Metadata.

The Transform Message configuration appears as follows.

The resulting DataWeave code is auto-generated:
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/csv
---
payload map ((payload01 , indexOfPayload01) -> {
	column_0: payload01.first_name,
	column_1: payload01.last_name,
	column_2: payload01.no,
	column_3: payload01.role
})
----
+
. Configure the file connector to save the CSV file to your file system.
. Configure the Logger to output the message displayed below, at log level `WARN`.
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
Total Records exported: #[message.payload.getLoadedRecords()], Failed Records: #[message.payload.getFailedRecords()], Processing time: #[message.payload.getElapsedTimeInMillis()]
----
. Run the app, check that the results appear in the file on your file system. Check the console and verify that logged messages appear as expected. For example:
+
`INFO  2017-08-14 09:42:47,170 [batch-job-myprojectBatch-work-manager.02] org.mule.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: Total Records exported: 100, Failed Records: 0, Processing time: 516`
+
. In the properties editor, click Terminate image:eclipse-terminate.png[stop app] to stop the app from running every ten minutes.
