== Frequently Asked Questions

=== How do I create a Private Exchange?

See link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-exchange#submitting-your-private-content-to-exchange[Submitting Your Private Content to Exchange].

Anypoint Exchange doesn't host your files but provides links to them. The content
you put in your Private Exchange must be hosted through an HTTP service.

To post content to your Exchange, use link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform], click *Exchange* and click *Add item*.

=== Why is there no install button for a connector?

If you locate a connector in Exchange, you can only view details about the connector.
To install a connector, first open link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio] and click the X icon in the Studio taskbar:

You can then locate and install the connector.

=== Why does Exchange display a blank screen in Internet Explorer from Studio?

Anypoint Exchange requires Internet Explorer 9 or later.

=== How do I change user accounts in Exchange?

You can change your user account in Studio. Right-click your project in
Package Explorer and click *Anypoint Platform* > *Configure* > *Anypoint Studio* > *Authentication* > *Add*. In the Anypoint Platform Sign In menu, enter your Anypoint Platform username and password. Click *Sign In*. You can also use the Anypoint Platform Sign In menu to register for access to Anypoint Platform for the first time.

=== Why are there no Exchange Roles in on-premise Anypoint Platform for business groups?

Exchange on-premise version currently does not support business groups.

=== Why can't users view the content of a sub-organization business group?

Users must be assigned to the Exchange Viewer role. Users can view the master organization without being assigned to the Exchange Viewer role, but not sub-org groups. If users are invited to a business group, they won't see other business groups until assigned Roles access.

To assign Exchange Viewer access, sign into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] and click *Access Management* > *Roles*. Click *Exchange Viewers* and the blue plus sign to add a user.
