== Frequently Asked Questions

=== How do I create a Private Exchange?

See link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-exchange#submitting-your-private-content-to-exchange[Submitting Your Private Content to Exchange].

Anypoint Exchange doesn't host your files but provides links to them. The content
you put in your Private Exchange must be hosted through an HTTP service.

To post content to your Exchange, use link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform], click *Exchange* and click *Add item*.

=== Why is there no install button for a connector?

If you locate a connector in Exchange, you can only view details about the connector.
To install a connector, first open link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio] and click the X icon in the Studio taskbar:

You can then locate and install the connector.
