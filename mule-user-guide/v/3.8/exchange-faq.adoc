See link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-exchange#submitting-your-private-content-to-exchange[Submitting Your Private Content to Exchange].

you put in your Private Exchange must be hosted through an HTTP service.

To post content to your Exchange, use link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform], click *Exchange* and click *Add item*.

If you locate a connector in Exchange, you can only view details about the connector.
To install a connector, first open link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio] and click the X icon in the Studio taskbar:

An example is a Studio project that you can run import into Studio and run that demonstrates how to handle a use case or solution. link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=example&sortBy=name[View examples in Anypoint Exchange].
