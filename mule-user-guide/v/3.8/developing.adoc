This chapter contains material for designing and developing applications with Mule.

Whether you chooise link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/first-30-minutes-with-mule[Anypoint Studio], Eclipse, IntelliJ, or another integration development environment to build applications that run on Mule – these materials provide the details you need to configure the building blocks of your application.

[NOTE]
====
Building blocks are anything you see in the palette in Anypoint Studio. Become familiar with these:

* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/components[Components]* are flexible tools which perform business logic implemented in Java and other scripting languages. 
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/filters[Filters]* only allow certain messages to continue to be processed in a flow.
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/routers[Routers]* control message flow to route, resequence, or split and aggregate messages in a flow.
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/scopes[Scopes]* wrap other messages processors so as to enable them to perform together as a group.
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/transformers[Transformers]* convert message payload type and data format to facilitate communication between systems. Some transformation is performed implicitly when communicating data between systems, such as between databases and Mule.
* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors]* - connect to external services via connectors, which abstract the implementation of the transport service implementation, see also link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/transports-reference[Transports]
* Inspect the Mule message when desiging your app with link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language MEL]
