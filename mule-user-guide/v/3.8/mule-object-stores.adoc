= Mule Object Stores
:keywords: esb, object store, objects, persist

An *object store* is a facility for storing objects. Mule uses object stores whenever it needs data to persist for later retrieval. Internally, Mule uses object stores in various filters, routers, and other message processors that need to store state between messages. In most cases, Mule creates and manages object stores automatically, so no user configuration is necessary.

== Use Cases

In most cases, Mule creates and manages object stores for you, so no configuration is necessary. However, you may explicitly configure an object store in the following cases:

* When configuring an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/idempotent-filter[idempotent message filter] or until a successful scope occurs.
* When configuring the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/endpoint-configuration-reference#redelivery-policy[*Idempotent Redelivery Policy*] of a custom endpoint.
* When configuring an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/splitter-flow-control-reference#aggregator-configuration[Aggregator], you can either use the two default built-in object stores or create a and reference of your own.
* When configuring a custom component that must use an object store to persist information.
* When storing or retrieving information from a Mule flow through the Object Store connector, link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/anypoint-platform/#!/object-store-integration-connector?searchTerm=object%20store&sortBy=rank[available for installation].

Mule provides two types of object stores:

* *In-memory store* – Stores objects in local Mule runtime memory. Objects will be lost when the Mule runtime shuts down.

* *Persistent store* – Mule persists data when an object store is explicitly configured to be persistent. In a stand-alone Mule runtime, Mule creates a default persistent store in the file system.

If you do not specify an object store, the default persistent object store is used.

For more information, see "Object Stores and Clustering" in the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/cache-scope[Cache Scope] document.

[TIP]
The default object store created for all new caching strategies supports cluster mode out of the box, with the exception of the cache scope which uses the old default caching strategy. For details, see the Object Stores and Clustering section in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/cache-scope[Cache Scope].

== XML Example

The following example demonstrates how to configure object stores in the following three situations:

. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/idempotent-filter[idempotent filter] with an in-memory object store.
. idempotent filter with a persistent object store.
. Until a successful scope occurs with an in-memory object store.
