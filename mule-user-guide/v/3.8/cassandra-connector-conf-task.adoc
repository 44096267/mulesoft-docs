= To Configure Cassandra Authentication

The Cassandra connector configuration needs to match the Cassandra configuration with regard to Basic Authentication. By default, accessing the Cassandra database does not require credentials. You need to configure the Cassandra authenticator to enable authentication. The default credentials are cassandra/cassandra, which you can change using cqlsh. After enabling authentication, you can access the database using your credentials. For example, in a terminal window, you can start cqlsh from the Cassandra installation home directory:

----
bin/cqlsh localhost -u cassandra -p cassandra
Connected to Test Cluster at localhost:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.10 | CQL spec 3.4.4 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
----

. After installing Cassandra, open `conf\cassandra.yaml` for editing.
. Optionally, change the value of AllowAllAuthenticator to PasswordAuthenticator. 
. Restart Cassandra.
. In a separate terminal tab, check that Cassandra is running:
+
`bin/nodetool status`
