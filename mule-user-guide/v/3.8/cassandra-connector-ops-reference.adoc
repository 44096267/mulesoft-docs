= Cassandra Connector Operations Reference

The Cassandra connector was implemented using the DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra 3.1. The connector exposes multiple operations that are described in the javadoc. Some of these processors accept some custom POJOs as input parameters, which are needed for the datasense functionality.

== Create Keyspace

This operation accepts a custom pojo CreateKeyspaceInput as input. 

Input for this operation is:

* Keyspace name
* Replication factor, for example 3
* Replication Strategy Class, for example NetworkRelicationStrategy 

Pass the parameters using a Transform Message component to transform the payload to a Java object.

----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
    "keyspaceName": payload.keyspaceName,
    "replicationFactor": payload.replicationFactor,
    "replicationStrategyClass": payload.replicationStrategyClass
} as :object {
    class : "com.mulesoft.mule.cassandradb.metadata.CreateKeyspaceInput"
}
----

== Drop Keyspace 

This operation accepts a String parameter representing the keyspace name.


== Create Table 

This operation accepts a custom pojo CreateTableInput as input.

Input for this operation is:

* Column names
* Table names
* Optional keyspace name

----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
    "columns": payload.columns,
    "tableName": payload.tableName,
    "keyspaceName": payload.keyspaceName
} as :object {
    class : "com.mulesoft.mule.cassandradb.metadata.CreateTableInput"
}
----

In this example, the keyspaceName parameter is optional. If you do not provide this parameter, when you run the application, the table is created in the keyspace specified in `mule.app.properties`.

== Drop Table

Input for this operation is:

* A table name
* The keyspace that contains the table


== Get Table Names From Keyspace

This operation has takes a string parameter specifying the keyspace name for the operation. The processor returns a list of tables in the specified keyspace.

== Execute CQL Query

Input for this operation is:

* A custom pojo (CQLQueryInput) 
+
A string representing the query. The query can be parametrized or not. 
* An optional list of parameters to pass to the parametrized query.
+
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
    "cqlQuery": payload.cqlQuery,
    "parameters": payload.parameters
}
as :object {
    class : "com.mulesoft.mule.cassandradb.metadata.CQLQueryInput"
}
+
Example of a HTTP request to the <execute-cql-query> processor:
[source]
{
"cqlQuery":"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (?,?)",
"parameters":
    [2,3]
}
----

== Select

Input for this operation is:

* A string representing the query
* An optional list of type Object representing the parameters for the query. 

You can build a query using a query builder.

== Insert

Input for this operation is:

* Parameter: a table name as a parameter
* Payload: a `Map<String, Object>` representing the entity to be inserted into the table.

----
tableName: users
payload:
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
    "id": payload.id,
    "name": payload.name,
    "other_property": payload.other_property
}
+
Example of HTTP request for the **Insert** operation:
[source]
{
    "id":3,
    "name":"entity_name",
    "other_property":other_property_value
}
----

== Update

Input for this operation is:

* Parameter: a table name
* Payload: `Map<String, Object>` with two records having the keys `where` and `columns`.
+
** `where Map<String, Object>`
+
Represents the clause that specifies the primary keys of the objects to be updated.
+
----
"where":
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "bestseller1"
      }
----
+
** `columns Map<String, Object>`
+
Represents pairs containing the column name and the value to be set for that column.
+
----
"columns":
    {
    "name": "test value"
    }
----

When you use the Transform Message component to set the payload for this operation, you see the details needed to set the payload.

// image:update_datasense.png[Config]

You can select which columns to update and specify the WHERE clause. The `columns` section contains all the columns of the table selected for the operation; whereas, in the `where` section only the columns that are part of the primary key are displayed. CQL syntax dictates that only columns in the primary key can be specified in the WHERE clause.

== Delete Columns Value

Input for this operation is:

* Parameter: a table name as a parameter
* Payload: a `Map<String, Object>` having two records with the keys `where` and `columns`.

Similar to the **Update** operation, the `where` record represents the clause that specifies the primary keys of the objects to be updated. The `columns` record represents a `List<String>` containing the column names to be cleared.

After invoking this operation when fetching the entities that were updated, the values for the columns specified in the **Delete Columns Value** operations are null.

You can store collections in specific columns in Cassandra. In this operation, you can delete specific values from those collections without deleting the whole collection.

The payload passed to the processor has the following structure:

----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
    "columns":payload.columns,
    "where":payload.where
}
----

An HTTP request for deleting an element from a list looks like this:

----
{
    "where":
      {
        "id": [1]
      },
      "columns": ["top_places[0]"]
}
----

An HTTP request for deleting an element from a map looks like this:

----
{
    "where":
      {
        "id": [1,2]
      },
      "columns": ["mapColumnName['keyName']"]
}
----

== Delete Rows

Input for this operation is:

* Parameter: a table name
* Payload a `Map<String, Object>` with one record having the key `where` and a value `Map<String, Object>` containing the WHERE clause.

If you want to delete a row from a table having a compound primary key,   in the `where` specify a map that contains the column names as keys and the column values as values. You can delete only one row at a time.

----
{
    "where":
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "name_to_delete"
      }
}
----

A compound primary key consists of multiple columns, one of which is the partition key. Others are clustering columns. In this example, id is the partition key and name is a clustering column.

If you want to delete a row from a table having a simple primary key, in the `where` specify a map that contains a single entry with the column name as the key and a list of values as the value. Multiple rows can be deleted at once.

----
{
    "where":
      {
        "id": [2,3]
      }
}
----


A simple primary key has a single column that is the partition key.

== Change Column Type

This operation changes the data type of a column to another valid and compatible type as defined by CQL and shown in the following tables:

*Valid Type Changes for Non-clustering Columns*

[frame=none]
|===
| *Change From* | *Change To*
| ascii, bigint, boolean, decimal, double, float, inet, int, timestamp, timeuuid, uuid, varchar, varint | blob 
| int | varint 
| text | varchar 
| timeuuid | uuid 
| varchar | text 
|===

*Valid Type Changes for Clustering Columns*

[frame=none]
|===
| *Change From* | *Change To*
| int | varint
| text | varchar
| varchar | text
|===

+
