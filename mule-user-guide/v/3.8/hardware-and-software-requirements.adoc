= Hardware and Software Requirements
:keywords: mule, requirements, jdk, installation, jre

You need to meet these general hardware and software requirements to set up Mule Runtime and use Anypoint Platform. Included at the end of this section are requirements for the Anypoint Connector DevKit. link:/release-notes/[Individual release notes] for complementary MuleSoft Products describe other requirements if there are any. 

This section does not include requirements for running the following products:

* Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition
+
See link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/prerequisites-platform-on-premises[On-premises documentation].
+
* API Gateway Runtime 2.x
+
Mule 3.8.0 and later incorporate API Gateway. To install API Gateway for an earlier Mule version, see requirements in link:/api-manager/api-gateway-runtime-archive[API Gateway Runtime--Archive].

== Mule Runtime Hardware Requirements

The minimum hardware required to run Mule Runtime depends on the application. For example, key factors in determining the RAM you need include the acceptable latency and the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process. The following hardware is the recommended minimum:

* 2GHz CPU or 1 virtual CPU in virtualized environments
* 1GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage

== Mule Runtime Software Requirements

Software requirements are:

* Java
+
The next section lists currently supported versions of Java versions. link:/release-notes/mule-esb[Mule Release Notes] lists the Java requirements for previous Mule releases. 
+
* An operating system that supports the Java versions listed in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/hardware-and-software-requirements#supported-java-versions[supported Java version]
+
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/supported-sw-and-systems#supported-operating-systems[Supported Operating Systems] lists operating systems that MuleSoft tests for use with Mule. 
+
* For Microsoft Dynamics GP connector use, link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html[Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 8] or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html[JCE 7] unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files

If you do not use this connector, you do not need JCE. Install a JRE or JDK first, then install JCE.

== API Gateway Runtime 2.x and 1.3.x

Mule 3.8.0 unifies the API Gateway runtime with the core Mule runtime, simplifying
development and operations. Mule continues to support and document API Gateway 2.x and 1.3.x for customers who do not plan to upgrade immediately.

The following requirements pertain to API Gateway Runtime 2.x and 1.3.x.

NOTE: After installing a JRE or JDK, install the link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html[Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 8] or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html[JCE 7] unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files.

=== API Gateway Runtime Hardware Requirements

* 2GHz, dual-core CPU, or 2 virtual CPUs in virtualized environments
* 2GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage

This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM Mule needs).

=== API Gateway Runtime Software Requirements

*Java Runtime Environments:*

* API Gateway Runtime 1.3.n and older: Oracle link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html#jre-7u80-oth-JPR[JRE 1.7]
* API Gateway Runtime 2.x:
** Oracle link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html[JRE 1.8]
** JRE 1.7.0 (recommended: link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html#jre-7u80-oth-JPR[JRE 1.7.0_79/80])
** IBM version 1.7

Because the only mandatory requirement for the API Gateway Runtime is Java, the API Gateway should also run on any later versions of the tested operating systems in the above list, as well as any other operating systems supported by the JRE.

=== Supported Operating Systems

API Gateway Runtime *2.x* validates against the following operating systems:

* Mac OS 10.10.0
* HP-UX 11i V3
* IBM AIX 7.1
* Microsoft Windows 2012 R2 Server
* Microsoft Windows 8.1
* Solaris 11.2
* RHEL 7
* Ubuntu Server 14.0.4

API Gateway Runtime *1.3.n and older* validates against the following operating systems:

* Microsoft Windows (32- and 64-bit) 2003, 2008, Windows 7, Windows 2012
* Mac OS 10.7, 10.8
* Linux RHEL (64-bit) 5.3, 6.1
* Ubuntu Server 12.04 (64-bit) - If you use SSL, MuleSoft recommends installing Ubuntu Server 12.14 (64-bit) and newer instead of 12.04.

== Anypoint Connector DevKit Requirements

Anypoint Connector DevKit 3.5 and later is compatible with
Mule versions 3.5 and later. DevKit version numbering
does not correspond to Mule versions. DevKit 3.9 is
compatible with Mule versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.

To take advantage of the latest fixes and improvements, use the current version of Mule with its corresponding DevKit.
latest fixes and improvements.

See link:/release-notes/anypoint-connector-devkit-release-notes[Anypoint Connector DevKit Release Notes] for the latest changes.
