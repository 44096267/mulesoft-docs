= Using Web Services

Mule is designed to facilitate the use of Web services in the following ways:

* Web services can be hosted or consumed
* Transport decoupled from protocol, that is, you can send / receive over JMS, email, etc.
* JAX-WS or Simple services
* Web services can be proxied or modified without much code
