= About Transformers (Deprecated)

In this release, you should use DataWeave expressions in the Transform component to perform data transformations instead of relying on the deprecated components, such as Object to XML and Object to String. Transformers are distinct from the Transform component.

[IMPORTANT]
Transformers are available only through the Compatibility module (available in Mule version 4.1). Transformers are deprecated for future releases.
