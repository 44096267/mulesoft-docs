= About Transformers

A Transformer is a Mule component that changes the contents of the Mule event.

Some examples of transformers are Object to XML and Object to String.

[CAUTION]
Transformers are included in Mule 4 Beta for compatibility reasons. They will be deprecated for future releases.
Transformations should be carried out through DataWeave expressions in the Transform component.
