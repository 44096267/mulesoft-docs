= About Transformers (Deprecated)

Transformers are available only through the Compatibility module (available in Mule version 4.1), and they are deprecated for future releases.

[IMPORTANT]
In this release, you should use DataWeave expressions in the Transform component to perform transformations instead of relying on the deprecated components.

Transformers are a type of Mule component that changes the contents of the Mule event. Some examples are Object to XML and Object to String. These are distinct from the Transform component.
