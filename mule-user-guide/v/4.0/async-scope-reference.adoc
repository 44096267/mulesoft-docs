= About the Async Scope
:keywords: Async, scopes, studio, anypoint

The Async scope is a branch processing block that executes simultaneously with the parent message flow. The main flow continues to execute while it initiates and processes the Async scope. The flow does not have to pause until the last message processor embedded in the asynchronous flow has completed its task.

Async can be useful for executing time-consuming operations that do not require you to send a response back to the initiating flow (such as printing a file or connecting to a mail server).

To facilitate simultaneous branch processing, the Async scope sends one copy of the message it has received to the first embedded message processor in its own processing block. At the same time, it sends another copy of the message to the next message processor in the main flow.

Because they operate on a copy of the message on a different thread, Async scopes do not support request-response exchange patterns.

// NOTE: THERE ARE NO PROCESSING STRATEGIES FOR ASYNC IN MULE 4
// If no processing strategy is configured for the Async scope, Mule applies a queued-Asynchronous processing strategy.

=== Async Scopes versus Asynchronous Flows

Like an asynchronous flow, the Async scope:

* Processes the message asynchronously with the main flow.
* Does not pass data from the scope back into the main flow thread.

Unlike an asynchronous flow, the Async scope:

* Exists inline with the main flow thread.
* Is not called by a Flow Reference component.
* Is not reusable.
* Cannot have its own exception handling strategy because it inherits one from the flow in which it resides.

=== Async Scopes versus Subflows

Like a subflow, the Async scope:

* Inherits the exception strategy of the main flow. 

Unlike a subflow, an Async scope:

* Processes messages asynchronously.
* Does not pass data back to the main flow.
* Exists inline with the main flow thread.
* Is not called by a Flow Reference component.
* Is not reusable

Note that even though the Async scope receives a copy of the Mule message, the payload is not copied. The same payload objects are referenced by both Mule messages: One that continues down the original flow, and the one processed by the Async scope.

In other words, if the payload of your message is a mutable object (for example, a bean with different fields in it) and a message processor in your Async scope changes the value of one of the fields, the message processors outside of the Async scope see the changed values.
