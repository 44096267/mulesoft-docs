= About Reconnection Strategies

When a Mule app starts, a connectivity test runs on components that connect to an external server, such as the FTP or Email connector. If the test fails, the default behavior is to log a warning message and continue with the deployment, instead of blocking it.

You can modify this behavior by setting reconnection attempts and by forcing the deployment to fail when all connection attempts fail.

* Reconnect: Attempts to reconnect a specified number of times at a given interval, for example, a limit of 5 reconnection attempts every 2000 milliseconds.

<ftp:config name="ftp>
  <ftp:connection host="localhost" user="me">
    <reconnection>
      <reconnect count="2">
    <reconnection>
  </ftp:connection>
</ftp:config>

* Reconnect Forever at a given interval, for example, every 10,000 milliseconds without any limit.
* Fail Deployment: To force the deployment to fail when connection (and reconnection) attempts fail, you can set Fails Deployment. For example, this configuration forces the deployment to fail after two unsuccessful reconnection attempts.
