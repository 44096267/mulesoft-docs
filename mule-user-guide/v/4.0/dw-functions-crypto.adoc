= DataWeave Encrypting Functions (dw::Crypto)

The functions described here are packaged in the Crypto module. The module is included with Mule runtime, but you must import it to your DataWeave code by adding the line `import dw::Crypto` to your header.


Example
[source,DataWeave, linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
import dw::Crypto
---
Crypto::MD5("asd" as Binary)
----

This module contains encrypting functions that follow common algorithms such as MD5, SHA1, etc.

== HMACBinary

=== HMACBinary(Binary, Binary): Binary

Computes a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) using the SHA1 hash function.


== HMACWith

=== HMACWith(Binary, Binary): String

Computes the HMAC hash and transforms and transforms the binary result into a hexadecimal lower case string.


== MD5

=== MD5(Binary): String

Computes the MD5 hash and transforms the binary result into a hexadecimal lower case string.

.Transform
----
%dw 2.0
import dw::Crypto
output application/json
---
Crypto::MD5("asd" as Binary)
----

.Output
----
"7815696ecbf1c96e6894b779456d330e"
----


== SHA1

=== SHA1(Binary): String

Computes the SHA1 hash and transforms and transforms the binary result into a hexadecimal lower case string.

.Transform
----
%dw 2.0
import dw::Crypto
output application/json
---
Crypto::SHA1("dsasd" as Binary),
----

.Output
----
"2fa183839c954e6366c206367c9be5864e4f4a65",
----


== HashWith

=== hashWith(Binary, String): Binary

Computes the hash of the specified content with the given algorithm name and returns the binary content.

Algorithm name can be

[%header%autowidth.spread]

|Name |Description
|MD2 |The MD2 message digest algorithm as defined in RFC 1319[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1319.txt].
|MD5 |The MD5 message digest algorithm as defined in RFC 1321[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt].
|SHA-1 SHA-256 SHA-384 SHA-512 | Hash algorithms defined in the FIPS PUB 180-2 [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/index.html]. SHA-256 is a 256-bit hash function intended to provide 128 bits of security against collision attacks, while SHA-512 is a 512-bit hash function intended to provide 256 bits of security. A 384-bit hash may be obtained by truncating the SHA-512 output.
