= To Use the Async Scope in a Flow
:keywords: Async, scopes, studio, anypoint

Async can be useful for executing time-consuming operations that do not require you to send a response back to the initiating flow (such as printing a file or connecting to a mail server).

. Within your Mule flow, add an Async component.
. Within the Async component, insert and configure the components you need to process the operation.
