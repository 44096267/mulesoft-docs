The Set Variable component is for creating a variable in the Mule event. You use them to store data for use in a Mule application. For example, you might store the original payload of a message (before it is processed) so you can use it later in the flow or within an exception strategy.

== Examples

This example sets the variable to a string:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `my first variable`

This example sets the variable by using a DataWeave operation that results in a value of `5`:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `#[max([1,2,3] ++ [3,4,5])]` in Anypoint Studio.

This example sets the variable to the message payload:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `payload` in Design Center, `#[payload]` in Anypoint Studio.

This example sets the variable to the message attributes:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `attributes` in Design Center, `#[attributes]` in Anypoint Studio.

This example sets the variable to the entire message:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `message` in Design Center, `#[message]` in Anypoint Studio.
