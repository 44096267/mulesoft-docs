= DataWeave Functions for URL (dw::core::URL)

The `encodeURI()` function encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character
(will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

Assumes that the URI is a complete URI, so does not encode reserved characters that have special meaning in the URI.

encodeURI replaces all characters except the following with the appropriate UTF-8 escape sequences:

Type	                | Includes
---------------------+----------------------------------------------
Reserved characters  | ; , / ? : @ & = $
Unescaped characters | alphabetic, decimal digits, - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )
Number sign          | #

== Compose

=== compose(Array<String>, Array<String>): String

Compose is a custom interpolator used to replace URL components by the encodeURIComponent result of it.
Example:
[source, dataweave]
----
 compose `http://asd/$(' texto a encodear ')/texto a encodear`
  ==
 'http://asd/%20texto%20a%20encodear%20/texto a encodear'

// TODO: MISSING EXAMPLE
== DecodeURI

=== decodeURI(String): String

The decodeURI() function decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI or by a similar routine.
Replaces each escape sequence in the encoded URI with the character that it represents,
but does not decode escape sequences that could not have been introduced by encodeURI.
The character `#` is not decoded from escape sequences.

// TODO: MISSING EXAMPLE
== DecodeURIComponent

=== decodeURIComponent(String): String

The decodeURIComponent() function decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component previously created by
encodeURIComponent or by a similar routine.

=== encodeURI(String): String


// TODO: MISSING EXAMPLE
== EncodeURIComponent

=== encodeURIComponent(String): String

The encodeURIComponent() function encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component by replacing each instance of certain characters by
one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character
(will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

encodeURIComponent escapes all characters except the following: alphabetic, decimal digits, - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )
encodeURIComponent differs from encodeURI in that it encodes reserved characters and the Number sign # of encodeURI:

Type	                | Includes
---------------------+----------------------------------------------
Reserved characters  |
Unescaped characters | alphabetic, decimal digits, - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )
Number sign          |


== ParseURI

=== parseURI(String): URI

Parses an URL and returns an URI object.
The `isValid: Boolean` property dennotes if the parse was succeed.
Every field in the URI object is optional, and it will be present only if it was present in the original URL
