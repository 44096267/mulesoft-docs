= About Mule Event

A Mule event is an object containing the core information processed by the runtime. It travels through Components inside your Mule application following the configured application logic.

[NOTE]
Do not confuse the event that triggers a Mule application with the Mule event. The Mule event is created in response to the external event.

A Mule event is generated when an _external event_ (such as an HTTP request, or a change to a database or file) reaches the Event source of a flow. This _external event_ can be triggered by a _resource_ that might be external to the Mule Application.

. An external event triggers the event source.
. The event source produces a Mule event object.
. The Mule event travels sequentially through the components of a flow.
. Each component interacts in a pre-defined manner with the Mule event.

A Mule Event is composed of:

* A Mule message
* Variables, which are pieces of information about the Mule Event meant to be used by the application that is processing it.

== Variables

// REVIEW: Require more context around variables.
In Mule terms, variables are used to hold metadata for the Mule event. These can be defined and referenced in your application.

Variables can store metadata resulting from different operations performed throughout the application or to add metadata to a processing Mule event.

// REVIEW: Would it make sense to show Event Context (ExecutionContext) ?
// === Event Context
//The ExecutionContext that does not change within the scope of a single request and has the orginalPayload, MEP, credentials as well as reference to txContext and muleContext.
