== DataWeave Migration

It's important to know that DataWeave has not always been the _de facto_ expression language Mule uses. Prior to version 4.0.0, the Mule Expression Language (MEL) was used for most needs, whilst DataWeave was reserved for only carrying out transformations.

[TIP]
====
For the simple use case of extracting a value from the Mule event, DataWeave syntax remains identical to that of MEL, so you might find that some scripts from older versions work in Mule 4 without any changes, even though they're technically being processed via a different language engine.

If you still need to use MEL, you can include it to your projects by adding the compatibility package.

[TIP]
Note that as of Mule 4.0.0, the Mule event structure is radically different, making it a lot simpler to reference its parts.
