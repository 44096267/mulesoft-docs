DataWeaveÂ is a MuleSoft language that you can use to access, evaluate, and transform data within a Mule message. DataWeave is tightly integrated with Anypoint Studio, Design Center, and Mule Runtime, and almost all of their message processors can evaluate DataWeave expressions to perform tasks like these:

* Extracting data that you need to access and use from the message payload, attributes, and variables.
+
At runtime, Mule evaluates DataWeave expressions that extract information from the Mule event and environment properties.
* Transforming input data to another format. For example, you might transform XML to JSON.
+
DataWeave supports a variety of transformations: simple one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-one mappings from an assortment of data structures, and can complete more elaborate mappings including normalization, grouping, joins, partitioning, pivoting and filtering.
* Routing data based on conditions you specify so that your flows handle the same data differently depending on your needs.

You can use DataWeave as a light expression language to reference values or invoke methods, or you can use it as a full-fledged scripting language to construct complex data transformations that include functions and recursion.

As a programming language, DataWeave provides set of common operators for acting on data, as well as selectors for specifying the data that you need to extract or act upon. It is capable of representing a wide range of types (such as arrays, objects, dates, strings, functions, iterators) and mapping them to a number of output formats (including JSON, XML, CSV) and to various Java types (such as `Enum`). It also allows you to create your own custom types and to coerce one type into another.
