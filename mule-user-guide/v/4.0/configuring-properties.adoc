= About Property Placeholders

Instead of using static values for connection configurations in your Mule app, you can create files that define property placeholders for values that you can edit and inject into the Mule app when deploying it.

There are two mechanisms for accomplishing this:

* Using a YAML file to set the default values. Then you can override specific values with system properties.
* Inject a system property (for example, `-Denvironment=dev`) and then use that to choose a file, for example:
+
`<configuration-properties file="${environment}.properties"/>`
