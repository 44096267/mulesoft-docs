= Monitoring and Debugging Applications

These topics show how to use the Mule Management Console Flows and Flow Analyzer tabs to monitor and track applications on a given server. Together, these tabs let you see what is happening within the application processing. In addition, you may be able to use this information to debug an application.

* link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Tracking+Flows[Tracking Flows] - The Flows tab shows you information about the different services and flows that make up applications deployed on the server. It gives you both high-level information about event processing for application flows and services and also lets you drill down for specific detailed information.

* link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Analyzing+Message+Flows[Analyzing Message Flows] - Switching to the Flow Analyzer tab you can retrieve specific information about application message flows. The Flow Analyzer screens let you trace message flows for an application, in effect, letting you see an application's message processing from start to finish. Since message flows are a key component in the Mule ESB server, the Flow Analyzer tab gives you the visibility you need to monitor messages as they flow through the application process and to identify problematic areas.

* link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Debugging+Message+Processing[Debugging Message Processing] - You can debug application message processing using the information available from the Flow Analyzer screens. You can step through the different message processors in use by an application and examine the message payload content as it enters and leaves each processor.

* link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Debugging+the+Loan+Broker+Example+Application[Debugging the Loan Broker Example Application] - This topic shows step-by-step how to use the Flow Analyzer to find and fix a bug in the simple loan broker example application.
