= Using Message Routers

Message routers are used within link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Using+Mule+Services[Using Mule Services] to control how messages are sent and received by components in the system. (Within link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Using+Flows+for+Service+Orchestration[Using Flows for Service Orchestration], the same job is performed by link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Message+Sources+and+Message+Processors#MessageSourcesandMessageProcessors-MessageProcessors[message processors].) See link:#UsingMessageRouters-overview[MULE3USER:Overview] below for a description of the different types of routers. Click a link in the Quick Reference table below for details on a specific router.

== Overview

link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Inbound+Routers[Inbound routers] control how a service handles incoming messages, such as selectively consuming only those messages that meet specific criteria or grouping messages together that share a group ID before forwarding them on.

link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Outbound+Routers[Outbound routers] control how a message is dispatched after the service has processed it, such as sending it to a list of recipients or splitting up the message and sending the parts to different endpoints.

link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Asynchronous+Reply+Routers[Asynchronous reply routers] are used in request/response scenarios where message traffic is triggered by a request and the traffic needs to be consolidated before a response is given. The classic example of this is where a request is made and tasks are executed in parallel. Each task must finish executing and the results processed before a response can be sent back.

link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Catch-all+Strategies[Catch-all strategies] are invoked if no routing path can be found for the current message. An inbound or outbound endpoint can be associated with a catch-all strategy so that any orphaned messages can be caught and routed to a common location.

Filters provide the logic used to invoke a particular router. Filters can be combined using the logic filters AndFilter, OrFilter, and NotFilter. Not all routers need to use filters, but all routers support them. See link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Using+Filters[Using Filters] for complete information.

Mule ESB provides flexible message routing support for your components. Routing features are based on the enterprise routing requirements described in http://eaipatterns.com[EIP]. For information on how your Java or Script components can orchestrate messages, see link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Component+Bindings[Component Bindings].

== Frequently Asked Questions

*When do I need an outbound router vs. simply getting a reply?* +
In simple scenarios, a service receives a request on a synchronous inbound endpoint, processes the request, and then sends it back to the caller as a reply. This is the link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Service+Messaging+Styles#ServiceMessagingStyles-requestresponse[request-response message style]. For example, if a user enters a value in an HTML form, and you want to transform that value and display the results in the same page, you can simply configure a synchronous inbound endpoint on the service that does the transformation. This scenario does not use an outbound router.

If you need to pass the message to a second service for additional processing, you configure an outbound router on the first service to pass the message to the second service. You configure a synchronous inbound endpoint on the second service so that it passes the message back to the first service, which then sends it back to the caller as a reply. This is the link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Service+Messaging+Styles#ServiceMessagingStyles-sync[synchronous message style].

In the most complex scenario, you can enable request-response messaging and allow the back-end process to be forked to invoke other services and return a result based on the results of multiple service invocations. This is the link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Service+Messaging+Styles#ServiceMessagingStyles-asyncrequestresponse[asynchronous request response message style].

See link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Service+Messaging+Styles[Service Messaging Styles] for more information.

*How do I create a nested router that calls a web service with multiple methods without having to hardcode the method name in the outbound endpoint?* +
The link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Outbound+Routers#OutboundRouters-template[template endpoint router] allows endpoints to be altered at runtime based on properties set on the current message or fallback values set on the endpoint properties.
