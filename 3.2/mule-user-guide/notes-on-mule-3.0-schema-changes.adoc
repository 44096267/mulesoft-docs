The following changes have been made to schemas within Mule 3.0.Â  For details on the schemas themselves, consult the link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Schema+Documentation[schemadoc] added with Mule 3.0.

== Core Mule

* The `synchronous` attribute has been removed in favor of the link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Configuring+Endpoints[exchange-pattern] attribute.
* link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Configuring+Endpoints#ConfiguringEndpoints-DynamicEndpoints[Dynamic endpoints] can be designated on most transports.
* Transformers, routers, filters, and other constructs that affect the processing of messages are now all link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Message+Sources+and+Message+Processors#MessageSourcesandMessageProcessors-MessageProcessors[Message Processors] and can be used more flexibly inside a Mule configuration.
* In addition to services, message processing can be configured using link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Using+Flows+for+Service+Orchestration[flows] and link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Using+Mule+Configuration+Patterns[configuration patterns].

== BPM

* link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/BPM+Module+Reference[BPM] now includes the element `jbpm-connector` to specify a jBpm connector.

== CXF

* The CXF schema is quite different now that CXF has been changed from a transport to a module. For details, see link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Upgrading+CXF+from+Mule+2[Upgrading CXF from Mule 2].

== E-mail

* The e-mail connectors (link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/IMAP+Transport+Reference[IMAP], link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/IMAP+Transport+Reference[IMAPS], link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/POP3+Transport+Reference[POP3], and link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/POP3+Transport+Reference[POP3S]) support a new attribute `moveToFolder`, which specifies a folder to move e-mail messages to after they have been read.

== File

* The legacy filename parser, used for Mule 1 compatibility, has been removed. The expression filename parser is now the default.

== HTTP

* The link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/HTTP+Transport+Reference[HTTP transport] defines a new transformer element `body-to-parameter-map-transformer`, which transforms the body of an HTTP message into a map.
* HTTP outbound endpoints now have the boolean attribute `follow-redirects`, which applies to HTTP GETs only.

== JMS

* link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/JMS+Transport+Reference[JMS] connectors have the new boolean attribute `embeddedMode`, which tells Mule to avoid using certain JMS features.

== Management

* In the link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/JMX+Management[Management module], the element `jmx-server` now takes the boolean attribute `createRmiRegistry`, which specifies whether to create an RMI registry if none exists.

== Quartz

* link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Quartz+Transport+Reference[Quartz] endpoints have a new boolean attribute `stateful`, which determines whether the current job is peristent.

== Servlet

* Inbound and global link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Servlet+Transport+Reference[Servlet] endpoints have a new attribute `path`, which specifies the path of the servlet to bind to.

== TCP

* A custom implementation for the link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/TCP+Transport+Reference[TCP] protocol can now be specified as a reference to a Spring bean.

== VM

* The connector no longer takes the attribute `queueEvents`. Queuing behavior is now determined by the endpoint's exchange pattern.

== XML

* The link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/XML+Module+Reference[XML] now includes JAXB and link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/XQuery+Support[XQuery Support] transformers and extensions.
* The `xml-to-object-transformer` element can now be further configured to customize XStream behavior.
