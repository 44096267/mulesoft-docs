= Using Web Services

Mule is designed to facilitate the use of Web services in the following ways:

* Web services can be hosted or consumed
* Transport decoupled from protocol, that is, you can send / receive over JMS, email, etc.
* JAX-WS or Simple services
* Web services can be proxied or modified without much code

link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Using+the+Mule+RESTpack[RESTpack] - Provides support for building RESTful services inside Mule. You can also use the REST service wrapper (a specialized Mule service component) in the http://www.mulesource.org/display/MULE2USER/HTTP+Transport#HTTPTransport-RestServiceComponent[HTTP transport] to proxy REST-style requests to external REST/HTTP services. This wrapper component acts as a REST client and is appropriate if you do not have strict REST requirements.
