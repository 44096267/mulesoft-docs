The *Anypoint Platform* comprises a complete application and API development suite that you can use to model, build, and transform existing applications and APIs or create new ones. With our platform, you can transform practically any digital resource for your needs and organizational goals.

Think of the Anypoint Platform as a bundle of products you can use across your organization as a vehicle of continuous improvement for your applications and API ecosystem. Get started and link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signup?apintent=exchange[Create an Anypoint Platform account].

Unlock the potential of your application architecture in the cloud or on-premises easily. Get started with one of our new application design and development link:/quickstarts/[Quickstarts] or start creating and managing APIs right away with *API Designer*.

[NOTE]
With our programming language-agnostic platform, you can use the development tools to iteratively develop in step with changing web service needs.

== Mule Application Development in Anypoint Studio

link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Anypoint Studio] is an IDE for integration applications that run on link:https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/what-mule-esb[Mule runtime], a flexible ESB that lets developers connect services or applications together quickly. Studio is mainly a visual design tool, and does not require in-depth knowledge of Mule runtime. Use Studio to add or switch out modular configurable building blocks in your application, then debug and test.

Mule applications comprise one or more user-defined *flows* whose building blocks each represent an *event* in the flow, defining how the Mule message is processed for the next stage in the flow. The building blocks of these flows are sometimes referred to as *components*; they have configurable fields that define how information is received, transformed and returned, like most software program functions would. However, you don’t have to code these elements yourself - they are accessible from a palette, and you can configure them from the user interface, which offers resources and tooltips to help you route and process data.

[NOTE]
Start setting up your link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/setting-up-your-development-environment[Development Environment] and get your feet wet by building integrations with Anypoint Studio, link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/begin-with-the-basics[Begin with the Basics of Mule].
You can design and develop your Mule applications using either the:

* *Graphical user interface* for drag-and-drop of flow elements and easy configuration in properties windows, or
* An *XML editor* where these same elements can be configured

Each building block in a Mule application flow represents a modular part of a process along which Mule messages are transmitted. Thanks to link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/datasense[DataSense], you can know the metadata that describes the Mule messages at any given point in a flow. This data may be accessed and referenced within your app, using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language (MEL)], which is a Mule application-specific syntax. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[DataWeave] is a powerful tool for data transformation accessible from the *Transform Message* component. Use Dataweave to transform data from one type to another through its intuitive UI. You can also code the desired transformation by hand in the editor.

[TIP]
link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/mule-message-structure[See] what is inside a Mule message.


Mule supports very many internet communications protocols out of the box, such as FTP and SMTP. Mule applications support use and re-use of elements called link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] that facilitate connections, normally to web services which handle essential business services: databases, SaaS providers, payment systems, etc. See the whole connector offering here on link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange].

[TIP]
If you do not see the Anypoint Connector you need in Anypoint Exchange, consider creating your own connector using the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/[Anypoint Connector DevKit]. link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/setting-up-your-dev-environment[Set up your development environment] and follow the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/devkit-tutorial[DevKit Tutorial].

You can also use link:/anypoint-mq/[Anypoint MQ] to coordinate messaging between applications, Object Store to share content between applications, and more.

After your Mule application has been designed, you can seamlessly add _unit testing_ to your continuous development environment using link:/munit/v/1.2.0/[MUnit], a Mule application testing framework embedded within Studio.

Make sure that your integrations and APIs behave the way you intend by designing and running _test suites_, a collection of tests using resources such as _assertions_, _verifications_, _mocks_, and _spies_. +
MUnit also allows you to run integration tests in a local environment allowing you to start a local FTP/SFTP, DB, or mail server.

Get quality metrics for your development by running link:/munit/v/1.2.0/munit-maven-support#coverage[coverage repots].

You can run your application and test suite from within the IDE using the embedded *Mule runtime*, or link:/anypoint-fundamentals/operate-and-manage[deploy your application] to production (or a development environment) in the cloud on *CloudHub*, also without having to leave the IDE.

== API Development

To elaborate on what design and development means for business transformation, consider the data you want to provide, govern, transform, and expose at various levels of your organization, both internally and for customers.

After planning your development strategy, you are ready to begin designing APIs to support each piece of the connectivity puzzle for your organization. We recommend using link:http://raml.org/[RAML], the API-modeling language, to describe your APIs. RAML allows you to define the methods and resources of a REST-ful API in a syntax similar to that of *YAML*. The Anypoint Platform even uses RAML to auto-generate interactive API documentation for each API via its own API Portal, and Anypoint Studio uses RAML scaffold Mule flows.

Let’s take a look at this diagram, a conceptual framework you can use to orient yourself in intelligent API design.

[diagram]

link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#accessing-api-designer[API Designer], accessible from the browser, or link:/apikit/[APIkit], commonly leveraged from within Studio. You can manage APIs defined in any format, by proxy for example. We promote API development following an API model where APIs are segmented into three logical layers of your organization:

* *System APIs*
* *Process APIs*
* *Experience APIs*

== Build an Application Network

Developing an application network is a process that involves redefining interactions with existing digital resources through creating APIs at different levels of the enterprise from the backend to the user experience. These APIs can be recomposed or changed out as business demands change.

MuleSoft provides the tools needed to create the APIs and applications that are the nodes in this network, between your systems and SaaS applications.
