= Tutorial: Object Store v2
:keywords: object store, tutorial

This document helps you use Object Store v2 (OSv2) to store and view data.

== Prerequisites

link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/object-store-connector[View the Object Store Connector guide] and 
link:/release-notes/objectstore-release-notes[Release Notes]. Also review the https://mulesoft.github.io/objectstore-connector/[Object Store Technical Reference].

== Tutorial Summary

image:osv2-overview.png[osv2-overview,width=500]

. Create an application in Anypoint Studio that contains the Object Store connector.
. Deploy the application from Studio to Runtime Manager.
. Start the application in Runtime Manager.
. Use a program such as curl or Postman to write data to the object store.
. View the object store data in Runtime Manager.

== Install This Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for this connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has a software update, it pops up a message in its lower right corner. Click to install.

== Create a Studio Project

. Open Anypoint Studio and create a new project using File > New > Mule Project. In this tutorial, the project name is `objstoredemo`.
. Create an application like this:
+

+
. Search for `http` and drag and drop the HTTP connector onto the Studio Canvas. The HTTP connector listens for the curl command we use to store a key and value in Object Store.
+
Click the green plus to the right of Connector Configuration and in the Global Element Properties screen, take the default settings (Host: 0.0.0.0 and Port: 8081) and click OK:
+

+
. In the HTTP properties screen, set Path to `/store` and Allowed Methods to `POST`:
+
image:osv2-http-properties.png[osv2-http-properties]
+
When we submit our curl command, we use the `/store` option in our URL,
for example, `objectstoredemo.cloudhub.io/store`. The Allowed Methods setting ensures that those using our curl command can only POST information to the object store. 
+
. Locate and add the Object to String component to the Studio Canvas. No settings are necessary -- this component converts the content received from the HTTP connector into a string.
. Locate and add the JSON to Object component. Set the Return Class*to `java.util.Map`:
+

+
. Search for `objectstore` and add the ObjectStore connector. If there is no object store connector,
install it as described in <<Configuring Object Store Access>>.
.. Click the green plus sign to the right of Connector Configuration and in the Global Element Properties screen, leave all the settings blank, and click OK.
.. Set the Operation to Store and set these Store operation values:
** Key to `#[payload.key]`
** Value Reference to `#[payload.value]`
+
image:osv2-connector.png[osv2-connector]
+
. Locate and add Set Payload. Set the Value field to `KEY: #[payload.key] AND VALUE: #[payload.value] WERE SAVED OK` - this message displays on the command line to let you know the curl command values are received by the application.
+

+
. Save the application and click Run > Run As > Mule Application. Running the application ensures your application works correctly. If you need to fix anything, do so now. After your application runs correctly, you can stop your application.

=== Deploy an Application in Anypoint Platform

You can deploy an application in the link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores#object-store-example[current CloudHub Object Store]. After you try this, you can use the information that follows to test OSv2.

To deploy your application:

. Right-click your application's name in Anypoint Studio's Package Explorer and click
Anypoint Platform > Deploy to Cloud.
. At the User login window, specify your Anypoint Platform username and password, and click Sign in. If you don't have an Anypoint Platform login, click Sign up.
. In Runtime Manager:

** Give the application a name. Each name is unique and becomes the URL under which your application
is stored in Runtime Manager. The URL has the APPLICATION_NAME.cloudhub.io format where your application resides
in the cloudhub.io namespace. Ensure the application name gets a green checkmark for proper naming and being unique.
** Set the Runtime Version.
** Click the Use Object Store v2 checkbox.
+
image:osv2-runtime_manager_deploy_app.png[osv2-runtime_manager_deploy_app]
+
. After configuring your application, click Deploy Application.
. Runtime Manager prompts you to ensure you want to make this choice.
. Start your application.

== Sending Data to the Object Store

From a command line prompt, use a utility to send JSON data to your Mule application. This can be a command such as
curl, Postman, or a browser extension. Any serializable data can be sent to the 
object store. The object store connector sends data as key/value pairs. 

Example using curl:

[source]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "key": "TestKey01", "value": "This is an object store test" }' "http://APPLICATION_NAME.cloudhub.io/store"
----

Change APPLICATION_NAME to the name you chose when you deployed your application. Each time you submit this command, change the key's name so that each key is unique.

== Viewing Data in the Object Store

To view data in the Object Store:

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click Runtime Manager.
. Click the name of your application to view the application's dashboard.
. Click Object Store from the left navigation bar:

+
The Object Store user interface appears as follows:
+

+
. Click the Object Store name. You can click a key name to view its value.
. You can delete keys by clicking the Key down-arrow symbol:
