:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises

When setting up a VMWare virtual machine, make sure to specify the root device as 50GB (or bigger) as follows:

Once finished, you should see a virtual machine that looks similar to the following:

Next, you will need to add the 3 other devices required for installation (HDD2, HDD3 and HDD4). To do this, click the "Add..." button, and select "Hard Disk":

Add set the size to 100GB for HDD2.

Once finished adding that disk, create another disk for HDD3, this time at least 250GB:

Next, create another disk for HDD4, this time at least 100GB:

Finally, create another disk for HDD5, this time 20GB:

When finished, your virtual machine should show 5 disks, similar to the following view:

Proceed with installation of Operating System and application as normal.
