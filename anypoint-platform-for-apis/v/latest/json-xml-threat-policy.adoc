= JSON and XML Threat Protection Policy
:keywords: XML, policy, validation

JSON and XML are prone to the same types of malicious injections, often characterized by inflated elements and nesting levels. Attackers use recursive techniques to consume memory resources. Dramatic swings in the size of the application data often signal a security problem. The JSON and XML threat protection policies help protect your applications from such intrusions.

In the event API gateway fails to detect an attack, you need to monitor and design your services architecture with layers of protection in addition to these policies.

== Protecting JSON Applications

Malicious attacks on JSON applications frequently involve an inordinate increase in the size and depth of the JSON payload. By its nature, JSON is vulnerable. The need to parse the JSON object makes it a target for  JavaScript injection and malicious code, inflicting damages upon evaluation.
Applying the JSON policy can help prevent recursive additions to levels of your JSON hierarchy and limit the size of your JSON payload.

You configure JSON threat protection using the *Apply "JSON threat protection" policy* dialog. link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies#applying-and-removing-policies[Open this dialog], set limits, and click apply to start protecting your JSON code:

== Protecting XML Applications

Malicious attacks on XML applications typically involve large, recursive payloads, XPath/XSLT or SQL injections, and CData. Using the XML Threat Protection policy, you can limit the size of things, such as maximum node depth and text node length, in your XML code to twart malicious attacks. You can limit the size of comments to prevent invasions through CData, for example. 

You configure XML threat protection using the *Apply "XML threat protection" policy* dialog. link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies#applying-and-removing-policies[Open this dialog], set limits, and click apply to start protecting your XML code:
