== Before You Begin

In order to complete this step of the walkthrough, you will need the RAML file that you created in your design step. If you didn't complete that step, you can jump in here using link:/docs/download/attachments/122752477/t-shirt.raml?version=1&modificationDate=1406728800387[this RAML file].

Note that this portion of the walkthrough only applies if you are either building an API from scratch or writing a RAML layer over an existing API. If you elected to proceed without working with RAML at all, you can skip this step and move straight to downloading and deploying a proxy for your API.

== About Anypoint Studio

Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse-based IDE that includes built-in support for creating RAML-based APIs. If you don't already have the latest version installed, please update to the latest version from within Studio by going to **Help > Check for Updates**. If you don't have Studio at all, you can download the latest version from the http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio[download page].

If you need an introduction to working with Anypoint Studio, check out the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio Essentials].

== Build Your Anypoint Studio Project

. Create a *New Studio Project*. Set the following in the fields of the new project wizard:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Value
|Name |`my-raml-implementation`
|Runtime |Mule Server 3.7 EE
|Add APIkit components |From RAML file or URL
|RAML File or URL |Download link:/docs/download/attachments/122752477/t-shirt.raml?version=1&modificationDate=1406728800387[this RAML file] and point to its location in your disk
|===
+
image:2015-07-14_17-12-18.png[2015-07-14_17-12-18] +
+
Notice the folder structure that was created into the package explorer of the project. You will build your API's functionality in the `t-shirt.xml` file, located in the `src/main/app` folder.
+
image:package+explorer.png[package+explorer]

. Take a look at the flows that were generated in your project. +
* A main flow receives requests via the HTTP Connector and then routes them based on their full path to the right flow. The APIkit Router's workings are based on the RAML definition. Once a message completes its transition through the flow it was forwarded to, it returns to the main flow to be sent back to the requester through the output branch of the HTTP Connector.
+
image:router+flow.png[router+flow]

* A flow for every operation described on your RAML file. This is where we'll build up the functionality of your API.
+
image:other+flows+initial+state.png[other+flows+initial+state]
+
[WARNING]
If you rename any of these flows, APIKit Router will not be able to find them, as it relies on flow names to locate flows.

* There's also a set of standard `400` error messages, which are always generated. You can customize the messages by changing what the action of the Set Payload element. Keep in mind that these flows will override the `400` responses you define in your RAML.
+
image:exceptions.png[exceptions]
+

. On the first flow, click the HTTP Connector, which will open this element's properties editor in the tab under the canvas. Next to the *Connector Configuration* field, click the edit icon to set the properties for the connector's global element. Change the port value (set to 8081 by default) into a dynamic property by writing `${http.port`} instead. You must now assign a value to the property `http.port`. To assign a value, open the file `mule-app.properties` in your project's `src/main/app` folder in the package explorer. You can open this file as a text file in Studio and edit it right there on the spot. In this file simply add a line with the following:
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
http.port=8081
----
+
Then save changes.
. On each of the three flows that are linked to the three Operations of your API, delete the *Set Payload* elements that appear by default.
. In the palette menu on the right of the screen, in the `connectors` section, look for the *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/web-service-consumer[Web Service Consumer]* building block. Drag one of these into every one of these three flows.
+
image:other+flows+w+wsc.png[other+flows+w+wsc] +
+

All three of them display error messages, this is because they're not yet configured. In Studio you can edit the attributes of an element by clicking it, which opens a properties editor tab in the lower section of the screen.
. Click the first of the Web Service Consumer building blocks. Then, in the properties editor tab, click on the green plus sign next to the Connector Configuration field to create a new link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/global-elements[Global Element].
+
image:get+to+a+GE.png[get+to+a+GE] +
+

A new window will pop up. Fill in the fields with the following:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Value
|Name |Web_Service_Consumer
|WSDL location |http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl
|Service |TshirtServicePortTypeService
|Port |TshirtServicePortTypePort
|Address |http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/
|===
+
[TIP]
As soon as you fill in the WSDL Location field, the rest will get automatically filled as this WSDL doesn't offer any alternatives for the other values.
+
image:GE.png[GE]
+
Click OK.

. Back in the properties editor of the Web Service Consumer, select the Connector Configuration that you just created, `Web_Service_Consumer`. The Web Service Consumer element will now read the WSDL and display the different operations available in the `Operation` field.
+
image:WSC+configured.png[WSC+configured]
+
In each instance of the Web Service Consumer in your project, pick the same Connector Configuration that you created for the first out of the dropdown menu, then pick in each case the operation that matches the flow as per the table below:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Flow |Operation
|`get:/products:t-shirt-config` |ListInventory
|`get:/orders/{orderId}/status:t-shirt-config` |TrackOrder
|`post:/orders:t-shirt-config` |OrderTShirt
|===
+
Your flows now all call out to the Web service, generating requests with the XML message structures that the Web service expects in each case. There's still a problem: the messages that arrive to your API are in a different JSON format, so you still need to map this incoming data to the expected one... and then also map the outgoing data to the requester's expected format.
. Download the file link:/docs/download/attachments/122752477/JSON-example-files.zip?version=1&modificationDate=1405112028441[JSON-example-files.zip] and uncompress it. Here you will find samples of the expected inputs and desired outputs, you can use them as references to know how to build your mappings.
. In the palette menu on the right of the screen, in the components section, look for the DataWeave transformer, labelled as *Transform Message*. You will include five instances of this element in your project. Drag a DataWeave transformer and place it to the right of the first Web Service Consumer, then add two more of them on each of the other two flows, one on the left and one on the right of each of the Web Service Consumers.
+
image:other+flows+w+dw.png[other+flows+w+dw]

. Click the first Transform Message element you placed, the one on the `get:/products:t-shirt-config` flow. Notice that the properties editor of the DataWeave element is split in three areas, one for the input, another for describing the transform in http://mulesoft.github.io/data-weave[DataWeave language], and the other for the output. Thanks to Studio's intelligent use of metadata, the available inputs are already available, you can navigate the tree to see the WSC outputs from the selected operation in your WSDL.
+
image:input+example.png[input+example]
+
You must now use them to construct DataWeave's output following the structure of the example:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
[{
    "productCode": "TS",
    "size": "S",
    "description": "Small T-shirt",
    "count": 30
 }]
----
+
To produce that output, you must write this transform into the transform section:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
 [{
    "productCode": payload.ListInventoryResponse.inventory.productCode,
    "size": payload.ListInventoryResponse.inventory.size,
    "description": payload.ListInventoryResponse.inventory.description,
    "count": payload.ListInventoryResponse.inventory.count
}]
----
+
[TIP]
Use autocomplete to help you write out the full path to each of the elements that come in the input.
+
Note that the preview displayed in the output section now matches the desired output:
+
image:dataweave1.png[dataweave1]

. Move on to the first DataWeave transformer in the `get:/orders/{orderId}/status:t-shirt-config` flow. You will see that in this case there already is a basic scaffolding laid out in the transform, based on the known expected input of the Web Service Consumer; however you have to select what to populate these fields with out of the known inputs. Two fields are required for the output:

** `orderId` (which arrives as a parameter in the URI path)
** `email` (which is an inbound property of the incoming message). 
+
The DataWeave code to populate those fields as desired is like this:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/xml
%namespace ns0 http://mulesoft.org/tshirt-service
---
{
    ns0#TrackOrder: {
        email: flowVars.orderId,
        orderId: inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.email
    }
}
----

. Move on to the next DataWeave element. To construct the output, you must check the examples once again, this time this is the desired structure:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
  "orderId": "4321",
  "status": "Delivered",
  "size": "M"
}
----
+
These are the same three fields that are sent as an output of the WSC, however they are in a different order from the one produced by the WSC, so you must specify each individually. Here's what your transform should look like:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
    "orderId": payload.TrackOrderResponse.orderId,
    "status": payload.TrackOrderResponse.status,
    "size": payload.TrackOrderResponse.size
}
----

. The two mappings in the `post:/orders:t-shirt-config` flow are also just as easy as this last one. In the first, an initial scaffolding is already laid out for you to complete with references to the input fields, simply fill each with a reference to an element of the payload. The final result should look like this:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/xml
%namespace ns0 http://mulesoft.org/tshirt-service
---
{
    ns0#OrderTshirt: {
        size: payload.size,
        email: payload.email,
        name: payload.name,
        address1: payload.address1,
        address2: payload.address2,
        city: payload.city,
        stateOrProvince: payload.stateOrProvince,
        postalCode: payload.postalCode,
        country: payload.country
    }
}
----
+
In the second DataWeave, the desired output must only have one field, that is easily attainable from the payload:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
    "orderId": "4321"
  }
----
+
This is the transform you must write to carry out this transformation:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
    "orderId": payload.TrackOrderResponse.orderId
}
----

. You're now all set! Save your project, and it's ready to deploy!

[TIP]
====
If you haven't been following through these steps and building your own project, that's okay, but you will need to have something to work with on the next steps of the walkthrough.

In that case, download link:/docs/download/attachments/122752477/my-raml-implementation.zip?version=2&modificationDate=1436909547658[this file] – it's what you would have as a result of following the steps in this page.
====

== Next

The next step is to deploy your API. Pick the option that works best for you.

*Deploy your API to a Mule runtime* if either of the following is true:

* you want to separate your implementation from your orchestration layer (recommended)
* your APIkit project contains multiple connectors other than HTTP, Jetty, Web Service Consumer, and two additional connectors. Although in this walkthrough example you have not added any other connectors, you could customize it further to add additional functionality, or you could just imagine that you did. Why does it matter how many different connectors you use? The API Gateway subscription includes a limited number of connectors for your APIs and proxy projects. Please mailto:support@mulesoft.com[contact us] for more information about pricing.

If you think this is likely, go to **link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-deploy-to-runtime[Deploy to Mule Runtime]**.

or

*Deploy your API directly to an on-premises or cloud API Gateway* if both of the following are true:

* you do not need to separate your implementation and orchestration into separate layers
* your APIkit project does not contain multiple additional connectors, beyond HTTP, Jetty, or Web Service Consumer connectors

If you think this is likely, go to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-deploy-to-gateway[*Deploy to API Gateway*].
