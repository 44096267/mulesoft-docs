= Anypoint Platform for APIs Walkthrough
:keywords: walkthrough, api

Welcome to the interactive walkthrough for the Anypoint Platform for APIs.

=== How does this work?

This walkthrough lets you "choose your own adventure" by giving you the opportunity to pick a path that best matches your role in our example use case. At the top of each walkthrough page, under the title, is a little blue label that indicates the permissions you need in the Anypoint Platform for APIs to perform the actions in the section. Depending on your focus, you may jump straight to a later point in the walkthrough that is relevant for your role. 

=== What's the use case?

Throughout the walkthrough, you work with an API that allows applications to request a promotional t-shirt from an available inventory. Everyone loves t-shirts, right?

=== What does the walkthrough cover?

Here's a high-level overview of the walkthrough. We suggest you start with *link:/docs/display/current/Walkthrough+Intro+Create[Create an API]* or *link:/docs/display/current/Walkthrough+Intro+Consume[Consume an API]*, but you can jump in wherever you like!

[TIP]
If you want to migrate or copy an existing API Version, you don't need to go through all these steps. You can simply link:/docs/display/current/Managing+API+Versions[export the existing API] to a .zip file and then import it into a new API Version.
