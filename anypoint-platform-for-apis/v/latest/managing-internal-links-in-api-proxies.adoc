= Managing Internal Links in API Proxies

If your API returns URLs that provide apps with internal links to other parts of the API, your API proxy application should be configured to modify those internal links with proxy substitutes, thereby continuing to manage traffic to and from the API through the proxy, where it can be governed by API Manager.

This document demonstrates how to configure your proxy application to replace links in your API's responses without needing to make any changes in your original API.

== Assumptions

This document assumes:

* that you have an API that has not been built to run on Mule ESB
* that you have built a proxy application so that you can govern the API through your link:/docs/display/current/Configuring+an+API+Gateway[API Gateway]
* that your API returns responses that contain URLs with internal links to your API – these internal links need to be replaced with proxy versions to maintain the integrity of the API proxy

Moreover, it assumes that you're familiar with the concept of proxying and REST APIs in general.

You also need to have downloaded and installed http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-studio[Anypoint Studio]. The steps in this document require some basic familiarity with the link:/docs/display/33X/Basic+Studio+Tutorial[Anypoint Studio interface] or experience with an Eclipse-based IDE. If you need a quick introduction to Mule Studio, check out the link:/docs/display/current/Anypoint+Studio+Essentials[Anypoint Studio Essentials].

[WARNING]
Keep in mind that proxy implementation will vary according to the needs of your use case. You can mailto:support@mulesoft.com[contact MuleSoft support] for assistance with your proxy application.


== Instructions

The following instructions provide an example configuration in Anypoint Studio that assumes that the API's response payload includes one or more internal links to the API.

[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....

. The links that must be changed are in the payload returned by your API. Make this payload easier to scan by transforming it into a string. Add an *Object to String* Transformer after the outbound endpoint that communicates with your API.

. Once the payload is converted into a string, a simple Groovy expression can replace the original base URI of the links for the proxy's domain. Drag an *Expression* component into the flow, after the Object to String Transformer.

Configure the Expression component with the following attributes:

[width="99a",cols="10a,90a",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|Display Name |Replace BaseUri in payload
|Expression |`message.setPayload(message.getPayload().toString().replace("https://myapi.com/", "http://localhost:8081/"));`
|===

Through this query, whenever the API returns a link to content in your API's domain, it is changed to be routed through the proxy. 

[NOTE]
====
In case your API may output payloads of different formats, add a link:/docs/display/current/Choice+Flow+Control+Reference[Choice Router] to treat each case accordingly:

. The links that must be changed are in the payload returned by your API.  Make this payload easier to scan by transforming it into a string. Add an `object-to-string-transformer` right after the outbound endpoint to your API.

. Once the payload is converted into a string, a simple Groovy expression can replace the original base URI of the links for the proxy's domain.  Add an *Expression* component into the flow, after the Object to String Transformer.

    <![CDATA[
        message.setPayload(message.getPayload().toString().replace("https://myapi.com/","http://localhost:8081/"));
    ]]>

Through this query, whenever the API returns a link to content in your API's domain, it is changed to be routed through the proxy.

[TIP]
====
In case your API may output payloads of different formats, add a link:/docs/display/current/Choice+Flow+Control+Reference[Choice Router] router to treat each case accordingly.
