. Click *APIs*.

When you sign in as a member of the API Creator role and click *APIs*, you see your organization's API administration page, which may or may not have APIs in it already. This page displays all APIs and all versions of those APIs that you are authorized to see with your account. If you are directed to your organization's Developer Portal instead, contact your Organization Administrator and ask to be added to the API Creator role so that you can complete this walkthrough.
+
. Click *Add new API*.

[WARNING]
Can't see that button? Contact your Organization Administrator and ask to be added to the API Creator role. Or, if you aren't interested in creating or managing APIs, you can jump to another part of the walkthrough to learn how to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-intro-consume[Consume an API].
+
. Enter a *name*, *version*, optional endpoint, and brief *description* of your API, as shown in the following table.

== Next

Assuming you created an administrative home for an API version, follow these links to create a brand new API or manage an existing API.

*I want to design a new API from scratch.*

. Click *Define API in API Designer* to start your API design.
. Follow instructions in  link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-design-new[Creating a RAML definition for a new API].

*I want to manage an existing API.*

Use the sample T-Shirt Service API to represent your existing API. Do you want to layer a RAML definition over this existing API, or manage the API exactly as it is? 

*I want to layer a RAML definition over my existing API.*

. Click *Define API in API Designer* to start your RAML layer.
. Follow instructions in  link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-design-existing[Creating RAML for an Existing API].

*Why would I do this?*

Layering a RAML definition over a legacy API gives you access to the API tooling offered with the Anypoint Platform for APIs: the API Console and API Notebook. RAML is an optional step for existing APIs, but can be very useful to provide robust, easy to consume documentation for application developers who want to consume your API.

*I want to manage my existing API as it is.*

Click link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-proxy[Deploy an API Proxy].

*I want to migrate or copy an existing API Version that I already deployed in the Anypoint Platform for APIs*

. Click link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-api-versions[export the existing API] to a .zip file.
. Import the file into a new API Version.

This is especially useful when handling an API that is deployed to several environments, such as Development, QA, and Production.
