= Set Up and Deploy a Proxy for the API
:keywords: api, notebook, client

In this step of the walkthrough you create a proxy for your API's inbound endpoint to deploy and govern the API with SLAs and runtime policies. The proxy endpoint is the one that you expose to your API users. After creating the proxy, you deploy the API using the proxy.

== Create an Endpoint

The first step is to create an endpoint for your API on the API Version Details page.

To get to this page:

. link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Sign in to the Anypoint Platform for APIs] and click *APIs*:
+

+
. Either click the version number of an existing API or click *Add new API* to create a new API.

+

+
. Click *Configure Endpoint*, under *API Status*.
+

+
The Configure Endpoint menu opens:
+

+
. In the *Type* field, select the type of endpoint from the list, based on your use case: +
** If you are entering the endpoint of an API which was built out using APIkit, select *HTTP* *URL*.
** If you proceeded straight here because you want to follow the path of managing an existing API without RAML, select *WSDL* (in our example we use a SOAP API.)
. Enter the URI of the HTTP Listener in your API, based on your use case: +
** If you selected RAML spec, enter the address of the HTTP Listener of your deployed APIkit application, which may be running on-premises or on CloudHub. For example: `http://localhost:8086/api` or `http://ab-tshirt-orders.cloudhub.io`
** If you selected WSDL, enter this address: `http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl`

+
. Click *Save*.

== Deploy and Download the Proxy

The endpoint you created for the API is tagged  "Not registered": At the bottom of the page, `There are no registered applications for this API Version` displays.

In order to manage the API behind this endpoint with SLAs and policies, the Anypoint Platform for APIs needs to register the endpoint with the agent.

. Click *Deploy Proxy* under API Status:
+

+
. If no changes are needed, click *Close*:
+
image:api-gw-deploy-proxy-menu.png[api-gw-deploy-proxy-menu]
+
You can select the option to create a new API Gateway instance on your computer and manage the instance using link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[Servers].
+
. To download a proxy for your API, click *Download proxy (for latest gateway version)*:
+
image:api-gw-download-proxy.png[api-gw-download-proxy,height=210,width=687]
+
Anypoint Platform automatically downloads the proxy as a .zip file.

Downloading a proxy if you're planning to deploy your proxy on premises or to deploy to CloudHub manually.

If you plan to deploy to CloudHub automatically, then there's no need to download the proxy.
