= Create an API Portal
:keywords: api, portal, console, portal

After deploying an API, you create an API Portal to publicize the API and attract a user community. In this walkthrough, you create a portal for users to consume your API and find assets, such as examples and custom policies. On the portal, you set up users to access the private API. From the portal editing environment, you include an API Notebook to convey technical workflows, for example, how to make an authenticated call to your RAML-based API. Include images, attachments, and an API Console for simulating calls to your RAML-based API. Engage the community through interaction with the API to solicit feedback and contributions.

To create an API Portal:

. Under *API Portal* on the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] for the T-Shirt Ordering Service API, select *Create new Portal* from the dropdown menu.

The Home page appears in editing mode, containing the description you entered when you created the API. You can edit the text using markdown.

To create additional pages use the *Add new*. You can also place external links directly in your left navigation.

You may also create headers to separate out content in your left navigation to make it easier to find. For instance, you might want to separate out your external links in a separate section. Click *Add new > Section header* and enter a title for the header, such as `Resources`. You can drag your section heading or any other left nav item up or down to reorder them.

Any changes you make to your left navigation are automatically saved. Changes that you make to your markdown pages need to be saved as drafts and published.

== Including an API Console

If you've defined your API using RAML before creating your API Portal, your API Console should automatically be included in your API Portal in your left navigation. Click on *API reference* to view it.

If you created your RAML definition _after_ creating your API Portal, the API Console is not automatically included in the left navigation of your portal. However, you can add it at any time by clicking **Add new... > API reference**.

If you don't have a RAML definition for your API, consider link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-design-existing[designing a RAML layer for your existing API] to take advantage of this automatic documentation.

== Customizing Your API Portal Theme

If you want to, you can adjust the look and feel of your API Portal by accessing the API Portal Theme Settings from the menu in the upper right corner.

Clicking this option opens a theme editor that allows you to customize your logo and color scheme.

Experiment as you wish with adjusting the settings, then click *Save* when you are satisfied. To view the results, return to your API Version Details page and click *View live portal*.

== Exposing Your API Portal

In order to allow other users to view your portal, you can either make your portal public or give specific users Portal Viewer permissions.

To make your API Portal public, select which items you would like to make public and click the eye ball above.

To add other users as editors of your API Portal, go back to your API Version Details page and click the *Permissions* tab.

You can grant permissions only to users who are already members of your Anypoint Platform organization. If you need to invite users to the organization, you must ask an Organization Administrator to do so from the Anypoint Organization Administration page. +

* If you haven't already done so, try your hand at link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-manage[managing your API] with SLA tiers and policies to enforce them.
* If you have already applied policies to your API, make sure to document them clearly on your portal so that developers understand how they are affected.
* Wish that you could add an API Console or API Notebook, but don't have a RAML description of your API? Consider using the API Designer to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-design-existing[design a RAML layer for your existing API] so that you can take advantage of the interactive documentation.
* Want to engage users even further? You can easily create an interactive tutorial for your users with the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-notebook[API Notebook]
