link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform[Sign up] to use Anypoint Platform, and then log into Anypoint Platform to access API Manager.

On the API Administration page, *Add new API* imports an existing API or adds a definition, typically just the API name and version. The API Administration page also lists the names and versions of the APIs you define or import. To start an API management task, click a version name. A page of controls for performing API management tasks on the selected version appears. For example:

Using controls on this page, you can perform API management tasks:

* View registered applications
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies[Apply policies]
* link://anypoint-platform-for-apis/defining-sla-tiers[Define SLA tiers]
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-users-and-roles-in-the-anypoint-platform#granting-permissions-from-the-api-version-details-page[Assign ownership of an API version or permission to view a portal]

Some API Manager controls might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased].
