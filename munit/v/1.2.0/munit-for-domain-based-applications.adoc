= MUnit Domain Support
:keywords: mule, esb, tests, qa, quality assurance, verify, functional testing, unit testing, stress testing

Mule allows you to define connectors and libraries in a _Mule Domain_, to which you can deploy different Mule applications. +
These _domain based applications_ can link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/shared-resources[share the resources configured in the domain] to which they were deployed.

With *Domain Support*, MUnit allows you to test applications that run referencing a mule domain.

[NOTE]
--
MUnit Domain Support in Anypoint Studio is available since Anypoint Studio 6.0.1 (which comes shipped with MUnit Studio Plugin 1.2.1).

== Using MUnit to Test Domain Based Applications

This section assumes that you are testing a Mule application for which you link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/shared-resources#creating-a-new-domain[created a domain project], and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/shared-resources#associating-applications-with-the-domain[associated said application to that domain].

MUnit support for domain based applications is designed to require the minimum change of code from your end to implement this new feature.

If your Mule Application depends on a Mule Domain, there are a few considerations to take into account based on the characteristics of your application and domain. For example, it depends if your domain and application projects are link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/enabling-maven-support-for-a-studio-project[Mavenized].

Domain is a mavenizable artifact
It should be installed in a .M2 repository
The dependency should be in the application pom


[WARNING]
--
Rregardless if your application is Maven based or not, when working in Anypoint Studio your Mule Domain must *always* be part of your workspace.

=== Testing Non Mavenized Domain Based Applications

Domain Support in MUnit for non mavenized projects works without the need of applying any extra configurations.

When running a test for a non mavenized project in Studio 6.0.1, MUnit searches your domain settings and checks if such configuration exists:

////
todo

[EXAMPLE] -- Maybe an image, Maybe a log fragment that shows it's looking for a domain????
////

=== Testing Mavenized Domain Based Applications

For a domain based Mule application to be able to run its MUnit test configurated with Maven, you need to add the _Mule Domain_ as a dependency in your `pom.xml` file.
