= About MUnit Maven Plugin
:version-info: 2.0 and newer
:keywords: munit, testing, unit testing

MUnit is a composition of several modules, all of which are necessary to run your MUnit test.

MUnit provides a Maven plugin that allows you to run your MUnit tests as part of your continuous integration environment. +
The MUnit Maven Plugin allows you to run MUnit tests from Maven.

// COMBAK: Update this if necessary
Do not combine MUnit modules of different versions. That is, the munit.version should be the same across all MUnit artifacts in your pom.xml, like the plugin or the runner. +
Regarding the Mule MUnit support module, the mule.munit.support.version should match the mule.version. For example, 3.7.0 version of the support module would be compatible with 3.7.0, 3.7.1, 3.7.2 and other versions of Mule, but not necessarily with 3.6.0.
