== About Imports

Each MUnit suite is meant to test a particular set of Mule flows. To do that, you need to tell MUnit where those flows are defined in your application structure. For this we use imports, which are in fact Spring imports.

[source, xml, linenums]
.Spring Import Example
----
<spring:beans>
  <spring:import resource="classpath:your-production-code.xml"/>
</spring:beans>
----

If you are using Anypoint Studio:

* In the Global Elements Tab of your MUnit Test Suite, go to your Import (Configuration) element, and double-click it to show the Global Element Properties.
* Edit the Resource: field with the reference of the .xml file name of the application you are testing.

WARNING: If your application is spread across multiple files and the components in those files cross-reference each other, you need to import all of the files.

Ideally, your production code and your flows should be arranged in a cohesive way -- this improves readability, maintainability and testability.
