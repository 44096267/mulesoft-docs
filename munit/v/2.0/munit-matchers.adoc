:version-info: 2.0 and later

MUnit matchers are a set of DataWeave functions to define mocks, verifications, and assertions conditions in terms of general values rather than specific hardcoded values.

A matcher is a boolean function. In most of the MUnit matchers, this function is a class type comparison. Its purpose is to validate if an argument belongs to a certain class type. +
A matcher does not receive parameters; rather, it's a parameter itself.

| equalTo(Object) | Checks that the expression is equal to a specific value | equalTo(0) +
equalTo(‘example’)
| not(Matcher) | Checks if the provided matcher is not successful | not(equalTo(0))
| withMediaType(String) | Checks that the expression’s media type is the one specified | withMediaType(‘text/xml’)
| withEncoding(String) | Checks that the expression’s encoding is the one specified | withEncoding(‘UTF-8’)
| both(Matcher, Matcher) | Checks that both provided matchers are successful | both(notNullValue(),equalTo(‘example’))

MUnit matchers are always used in combination with the Mocks, Spy, and Assert message processors, but never on their own.
