MUnit is a Mule application testing framework that allows you to easily build automated tests for your integrations and APIs. It provides a full suite of integration and unit test capabilities, and is fully integrated with Maven and Surefire for integration with your continuous deployment environment.

With MUnit you can:

* Create your Mule test by writing Mule code
* Create your Mule test by writing Java code
* Disable flow inbound endpoints
* Disable endpoint connectors
* Mock outbound endpoints
* Mock message processors
* Spy any message processor
* Verify message processor calls
* Create not only unit tests but also integration tests in a local environment -- MUnit allows you to start a local FTP/SFTP or DB server
* Call the Mule client from Mule code
* Assert flow exceptions
* Enable or disable particular tests
* See assertion/error reports with Mule stack trace
* Extend the MUnit framework with plugins
* Check visual coverage in Studio
* Debug your tests with Studio


MUnit version 2.0, works with all Mule versions since 4.0

MUnit is divided among several sub modules. From a user's point of view there are only two that are really important. Both modules are compatible amongst themselves.
