= Message Sources and Message Processors

Mule 3 provides two different constructs that can be used to build applications:

* link:/docs/display/33X/Using+Flows+for+Service+Orchestration[Flows]. A flow is a combination of message sources and message processors that doesn't have a fixed format. It can be as simple or as complex as required, and can include, for instance, processing by multiple components before any output is performed.

* link:/docs/display/33X/Using+Mule+Configuration+Patterns[Configuration Patterns]. A configuration pattern is like a pre-built flow: the logic is already built into it, so that only some simple tailoring is needed to make it functional.

A Mule application can contain any or all of these.

Within flows, the streamlined architecture of Mule 3 allows link:/docs/display/33X/Using+Transformers[Transformers], link:/docs/display/33X/Using+Filters[Filters], link:/docs/display/33X/Configuring+Components[Components], link:#MessageSourcesandMessageProcessors-ControlMessageFlow[Routers] and other message processing artifacts to be used, and nested, freely as required. They all implement a common MessageProcessor interface and can be used interchangeably.

Here you'll find information about the different building blocks provided by Mule presented in categories.

== Message Sources

A message source receives or generates new messages to be processed by Mule. Mule supports the following types of message sources:

* link:#MessageSourcesandMessageProcessors-inends[Inbound Endpoints]
* link:#MessageSourcesandMessageProcessors-polls[Polls]
* link:#MessageSourcesandMessageProcessors-customms[Custom message sources]

=== Inbound Endpoints

Inbound Endpoints receive new messages from a channel or resource by using a server socket, polling a remote socket or resource, or by registering a listener.

For information about available transports see link:/docs/display/33X/Connecting+Using+Transports[Connecting Using Transports]

For information about configuring endpoints see link:/docs/display/33X/Configuring+Endpoints[Configuring Endpoints]

=== Polls

Rather than using an inbound endpoint you can poll any message processor and use the result as the source of your flow. A frequency in milliseconds can be configured otherwise the default of 1s is used. Examples of things you can poll are outbound-endpoints, other flows or processor chains or any message processor.

To configure polling use the _<poll>_ element instead of an inbound endpoint.

[source]
----
<flow name="myFlow">
   <poll frequency="2000">
        <http:outbound-endpoint host=".." port=".."/>
   </poll>
   <processor ref=""/>
   <processor ref=""/>
</flow>
----

_Currently <poll> has no support for cron expression of for customizing it's threading profile_

=== Custom Message Sources

You can replace any inbound endpoint in a flow with a custom message source. This allows you to use any class as a message source to the flow, including connectors. You configure the custom message source using the _<custom-source>_ element. In the element you identify the class for the custom source. You can further configure the custom message source using Spring bean properties.

The following code example configures a custom message source for a flow:

[source]
----
<flow name="useMyCustomSource">
   <custom-source class="org.my.customClass">
      <spring:property name="threads" value="500"/>
   </custom-source>
   <vm:outbound-endpoint path="output" exchange-pattern="one-way"/>
</flow>
----
