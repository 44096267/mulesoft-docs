= Preparing a Community DataMapper Project to Run on Enterprise

Mule allows you to develop and preview AnypointÂ DataMapper-enabled applications with the Studio graphical interface included in both the Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE) editions. However, only the Enterprise edition server can actually run these DataMapper-enabled applications. Therefore, you need to prepare the Datamapper projects you have developed in CE by completing the following tasks:

. Export your project from your CE instance of Mule.
. Import your project into your new EE Mule instance.

== Exporting a Project From Mule CE

. In Mule Studio CE, click the *File* menu, then select *Save*.
. Click the *File* menu again, then select *Export*.
. In the *Export* wizard, click the plus image:/docs/s/en_GB/3391/c989735defd8798a9d5e69c058c254be2e5a762b.76/_/images/icons/emoticons/add.png[(plus)] or (arrow >) icon to the left of *Mule*.
