== Overview

You can configure a Mule console to leverage an LDAP server for user authentication. In this use case, the LDAP server creates and manages users, and no information about users is stored on the console. Group information is managed both on the LDAP server and on the console.

The following table lists user and group information, specifying where it is stored and managed:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Information |Management and Storage
|User names and passwords |LDAP database
|Groups names and group members |LDAP database
|Groups names and group permissions |Console
|===

Groups have to be created both on the LDAP server and on the console. When the console authenticates a user through LDAP, it requests the user's group information from the LDAP server, and then assigns the appropriate permissions for the user based on the groups to which the user belongs.

When using LDAP, the console needs to authenticate _itself_ on the LDAP server to gain access to the LDAP database. The console needs to log in with a user account defined on the LDAP database. This user account can be any one of the accounts set up for users of the console, or it can be a separate account altogether (not belonging to any group) whose sole purpose is to authenticate the console.

For example, you can create a user on the LDAP database called `mmc`, and configure the console to connect to the LDAP server using `mmc`'s credentials. When a user logs into the console — as user `admin`, for example — the console first authenticates _itself_ on the LDAP server using `mmc`'s credentials, then it sends `admin`'s credentials to the LDAP server. If `admin`'s credentials are valid, the LDAP server provides the console with `admin`'s group information. The console then grants appropriate permissions to `admin` in accordance with the permissions specified for the groups to which `admin` belongs.

The last section of this document provides an link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-Example[example] detailing this configuration.

To configure the console to authenticate users via LDAP, perform the following high-level tasks:

* link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-ObtainLDAPparameters[Obtain LDAP parameters]
* link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-SetupusersandgroupsonLDAP[Set up users and groups on LDAP]
* link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-EnablingtheLDAPSpringprofile[Enable the LDAP Spring profile]
* link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-EnablingLDAPontheconsole[Enable LDAP on the console]

== Obtain LDAP parameters

Ask your LDAP server administrator for the following information:

* *The LDAP host and listening port*. The host can be an IP address or hostname. Example: `192.168.1.14` on port `389`.
* *The LDAP user account credentials that the console uses to connect to LDAP*. This is the user account configured on the LDAP server that allows the console access to the database storing information about the console users. Example: user: `mmc` password: `mmc123`
* *Structure of the LDAP tree that stores user and group information for console users*. This data provides the base context and attributes that the console uses to search within LDAP for users. The LDAP server administrator can export these values from the LDAP server onto a text file called an LDIF file (for LDAP Data Interchange Format). The link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-Example[example] provided in this document includes the LDIF export for the illustrated working configuration (see link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-PopulatingtheLDAPdatabasebyimportinganLDIFfile[Populating the LDAP database by importing an LDIF file])

== Set up users and groups on LDAP

You must create all users on the LDAP server. In other words, it is not possible to create users on LDAP via the console, since the console can only read the LDAP database, and cannot write to it.

User groups must be created on LDAP, and _also on the console_. As described link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-ManagementandStorageTable[above], group permissions are defined and stored on the console.

The following table lists user- and group-related tasks, specifying whether they are performed on the console or the LDAP server (or both).

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Description |Performed on the console |Performed on the LDAP server
|Create users |  |X
|Set user passwords |  |X
|Create groups |X |X
|Assign users to groups |  |X
|Set group permissions |X | 
|===

You must create all console users under the same subtree of the LDAP database, since the console will search for these users under a single base context. For example, you can create all users under the same organizational unit. In such a case, all console users share the same Relative Distinguished Name (RDN), such as `ou=people,dc=company,dc=org`.

== Enabling LDAP on the console

You must enable LDAP on the console so that the console can authenticate users against the LDAP server. The procedure involves two steps:

. link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-EnablingtheLDAPSpringprofile[Enabling the LDAP Spring profile]
. link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-CreatingtheLDAPConfigurationfile[Creating the LDAP Configuration file]

These steps involve the following two files:

* `<Mule install path>/apps/mmc/webapps/mmc/WEB-INF/web.xml`, which instructs the console to enable the LDAP spring profile, which is necessary for LDAP authentication.
* `<Mule install path>/apps/mmc/webapps/mmc/WEB-INF/classes/mmc-ldap.properties`, which contains the information necessary to connect to an LDAP server and to search for users on that server.

=== Enabling the LDAP Spring Profile

Complete the following steps:

. Navigate to the following directory: `<Mule install path>/apps/mmc/webapps/mmc/WEB-INF`
. Locate the file `web.xml`. 
. Open it with your favorite text editor, then locate the following line:
+
. Modify the next line to include the LDAP Spring profile as a value: 
+
+
 +
 +

=== Creating the LDAP Configuration File

Complete the following steps:

. Navigate to the `classpath` directory: `<Mule install path>/apps/mmc/webapps/mmc/WEB-INF/classes`
. Create a file called `mmc-ldap.properties`. This will be the LDAP configuration file.
+
[cols=",",]
|===
|image:/docs/images/icons/emoticons/information.png[image] |For Tomcat, the classpath directory is `/lib`.

|===
. Include in this configuration file all the required parameters, substituting the values specific to your environment into the listing below:
+

The following table describes the properties set through the configuration file:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Property |Description
|`providerURL` |URL, including listening port, of the LDAP server
|`userDn` |Distinguished Name (DN) of the _console user_, i.e. the user the console uses to log in to the LDAP server and gain access to the LDAP database.
|`password` |The password of the _console user_. This is the password property of the `initialDirContextFactory` bean.
|`usernameAttribute` |Used to override the default value of the `usernameAttribute` parameter in `org.mule.galaxy.security.ldap.UserLdapEntryMapper`, which is required for ActiveDirectory configuration. The default is `uid`.
|`userSearchBaseContext` |The base context within the LDAP tree structure in which the console searches for users. This is the first `<constructor-arg>` of the `userSearch` bean.
|`userSearchFilterExpression` |A filter expression used to find entries in the LDAP database that match a particular user. For example, (uid=\{0}) looks for an entry whose `uid` attribute matches the user name as it was supplied to the console in the *Username* field at login. This is the second `<constructor-arg>` of the `userSearch` bean
|`userSearchBase` |The base context in the LDAP database in which the console will search for users. This is the (`userSearchBase` property of the `userManagerTarget` bean).
|`userSearchAttributeKey` |The attribute used to search for users on the LDAP server. This is the (`userSearchAttributes` property of the `UserManagerTarget` bean).
|`userSearchAttributeValue` |This is the value of the attribute used to search for users on the LDAP server.
|`roleDn` |The DN of the context used to search for groups to which the user belongs. This is the second <constructor-arg> of the `ldapAuthoritiesPopulator bean`.
|`groupSearchFilter` |A filter expression that finds roles. For instance, `(member={0})` searches for groups inside the `groupSearchBase` that have an attribute called `member`, whose values contain the user name supplied to the console in the *Username* field at login. This is the `groupSearchFilter` property of the \{`ldapAuthoritiesPopulator`} bean.
|===

You can configure user and group search parameters to suit the structure of the LDAP database containing user entries.

== Implementing the Setup

=== Method One: Authenticating Console Users

. On the LDAP server, create a group called `Administrators`.
. Define a user belonging to that group.
. Enable LDAP on the console.
. Log in to the console as the user who belongs to the `Administrators` group.

The console automatically assigns full administrative privileges to any user belonging to the group `Administrators`, so on login, you have full administrative privileges on the console. You can then create other groups on the console and assign the desired permissions. You preform all further user configuration, such as adding/removing users from groups, on the LDAP server. After this, you may remove the `Administrators` group from the LDAP server if you desire.

  Click for the above procedure in detail

==== Using the Console’s Administrator Role to Set Up Groups

Assume that the domain for the LDAP database is **company.com**. Users are stored in the Organizational Unit *people*, and groups are stored in the Organizational Unit *groups*.

On the LDAP server:

. Create a user, for example `admin`. The DN of the user will be: `cn=admin,ou=people,dc=company,dc=com`.
. Set the user's password.
. Create a group called `Administrators`. The DN of the group will be `cn=Administrators,ou=groups,dc=company,dc=com`.
. Set the attribute `member` of group `Administrators` to include user `admin`.

On the console:

. Stop the console.
. Enable LDAP on the console (see instructions link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-EnablingLDAPontheconsole[above]).
. Re-start the console.
. Log in as user `admin`, using the password set on the LDAP server.

The console authenticates you as user `admin` on the LDAP server, belonging to the group `Administrators`. So after you log in, the Dashboard provides full functionality provided for users with administrative privileges:

image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/Dashboard.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1338342294796[image]

You can now create new groups, and modify the permissions of existing groups. To do so, click *Manage Users and Permissions* on the Dashboard, or click *Administration*, then *User Groups*.

After creating/modifying groups to your desired configuration, you may remove the `Administrators` group from the LDAP server if desired.

=== Method Two: Authenticating Console Users

. Create all necessary users and groups on the LDAP server.
. Launch the console _without_ LDAP enabled.
. Log in to the console.
. Create groups that match the groups already created on the LDAP server.
. Assign appropriate permissions to each group.
. Stop the console.
. Enable LDAP on the console.
. Restart the console, then log in.

== Example: A Simple LDAP Setup

This example illustrates a simple LDAP configuration, in which the LDAP server and the console exist on the same machine. Specifically, the exercise covers installation and basic configuration of an LDAP server on a Debian-based Linux system. To complete the steps described below, you should be familiar with software installation and configuration on Linux systems.

=== The Environment

This example was created using the following system specifications:

* O.S.: Linux (Xubuntu 12.04 LTS, based on Debian 7 “Wheezy/Sid”). Homepage: http://xubuntu.org
* LDAP Server: OpenLDAP. Homepage: http://www.openldap.org
* LDAP browser: Apache Directory Studio. Homepage: http://directory.apache.org/studio/

This example provides a basic overview of the following tasks:

* link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-DownloadinginstallingOpenLDAP[Download and install the OpenLDAP server and utilities]
* link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-DownloadingandinstallingtheApacheDirectoryStudioLDAPbrowser[Download and install the Apache Directory Studio LDAP browser]
* link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-ConfiguringtheLDAPServer[Configure the LDAP server and create the database]
* link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-PopulatingtheLDAPdatabaseusingaGUI[Create LDAP users and groups using Apache Directory Studio] (or alternatively, link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-PopulatingtheLDAPdatabasebyimportinganLDIFfile[create the users and groups by importing an LDIF file])
* link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-ConfiguretheconsoleforLDAP[Configure the console for use with LDAP]

=== Downloading and installing the OpenLDAP server

==== OpenLDAP installation options

OpenLDAP is a free, open source LDAP server available for many platforms including most flavors of Unix, Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The easiest way to set up OpenLDAP is to install the appropriate packages within a Linux distribution such as Debian, Suse, Red Hat, etc.

The OpenLDAP project distributes the software only in source form, which can be obtained http://www.openldap.org/software/download/[here]. Be sure to check the FAQ http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/1.html[here].

Additionally, several third-party, prepackaged versions are available for download. Of these, the http://lirone.symas.net/symas-com/[Symas Corporation] includes a paid version for Microsoft Windows.

==== Installing on Debian-based Linux distributions

The OpenLDAP server and the client programs are available in separate packages, respectively called `slapd` and `ldap-utils`. The `ldap-utils` package includes client utilities such as `ldapadd` and `ldapmodify`, which allow you to read and manage LDAP databases via the command line.

To install both packages, run the following command as root:

 Running commands as root on some Debian-based systems

[cols=",",]
|====
|image:/docs/images/icons/emoticons/check.png[image] a|

On some Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu or its derivatives, the usual procedure to run commands as root is to issue: `sudo <command>`

Alternatively, you can become root by running (as a user properly authorized in the `/etc/sudoers` file) the following command: `sudo su -`

|====

Another way to install OpenLDAP is to use a package manager such as `synaptic`, which provides a graphical interface to the system's package database. `synaptic` is usually installed by default, and available on the system menu under *System* > *Synaptic Package Manager*. In `synaptic`, select the packages `slapd` and `ldap-utils`, then apply the changes.

=== Downloading and installing the Apache Directory Studio LDAP browser

Apache Directory Studio is a free and open source, Eclipse-based LDAP browser and client for use with any LDAP server. It's available for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. It can be downloaded directly from the project's http://directory.apache.org/studio/[home page]. Sources are available on the http://directory.apache.org/studio/downloads.html[download page].

Installing Apache Directory Studio is very simple — just uncompress and unpack the install file and run the program binary. Installation instructions for each supported platform can be found http://directory.apache.org/studio/static/users_guide/apache_directory_studio/download_install.html[here].

 Uncompressing and unpacking gzipped tar files

[cols=",",]
|===
|image:/docs/images/icons/emoticons/check.png[image] |The Apache Studio installer file for linux is a gzipped tar file (`.tar.gz`). Most Linux file managers, such as `Nautilus` or `Thunar`, provide a way to uncompress and unpack these files using a graphical interface, usually by right-clicking the file and selecting *Open with Archive Manager* or a similar option. To decompress and unpack the file on the command line, navigate to the directory where the file was downloaded and run the following command: `tar zxvf <file>`

|===

=== Network Configuration

For this example, we run the OpenLDAP server on the default port on the local machine.

LDAP host: `127.0.0.1` +
 LDAP port: `389`

=== Configuring the LDAP Server

The OpenLDAP server runs as a daemon called `slapd`. After installing the distribution package, the daemon starts automatically with its default configuration, which it reads from the `/etc/slapd.d` directory.

In this example, we modify `slapd`'s configuration to read its parameters from the system-wide LDAP configuration file, `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf`. We then modify this file to include the definition for the database containing the LDAP users. This includes four steps:

. link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-Stoppingtheslapddaemon[Stop the `slapd` daemon]
. link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-ModifyingLDAP&#39;sdefaultparametersfile[Modify slapd's default parameters file, `/etc/default/slapd`]
. link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-Modifyingthesystem-wideLDAPconfigurationfile[Modify the system-wide LDAP configuration file, `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf`]
. link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-Restartingthe{{slapd}}daemon[Restart the `slapd` daemon]

==== Stopping the `slapd` daemon

To verify that the `slapd` daemon is running, open a terminal and issue the following command: `ps aux | grep slapd`

If the daemon is running, the command will return something like the following:

When the above appears, stop the daemon by issuing the following command as root: `service slapd stop`

Finally, verify that it has effectively stopped, by re-issuing the `ps aux` command.

==== Modifying slapd's default parameters file

[cols=",",]
|===
|image:/docs/images/icons/emoticons/check.png[image] |When you modify configuration files, you should backup the original file. For example, make a copy called `<file>.bak` or `<file>.orig` in the same directory.

|===

After stopping the `slapd` daemon, open the file `/etc/default/slapd` with a text editor. Find and replace the following entries, as shown below:

. Find the line that begins with `SLAPD_CONF`, and re-write it to read: `SLAPD_CONF=/etc/ldap/ldap.conf` +
 +
 This tells the `slapd` daemon to read its configuration from the system-wide LDAP configuration file, `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf`, which we will modify in the following step.
. Find the line that begins with `SLAPD_PIDFILE`, and re-write it to read: `(SLAPD_PIDFILE=/var/run/slapd.pid` +
 +
 This tells the daemon to write the its *Process Identification Number* (PID) to the file `/var/run/slapd.pid`. The daemon will not start without this setting.
. Find the line that begins with `SLAPD_SERVICES`, and re-write it to read: `SLAPD_SERVICES="ldap://0.0.0.0:389/"` +
 +
 This instructs the daemon to listen on port `389` (the default port) on all network interfaces.

==== Modify the System-wide LDAP Configuration File

. Backup the contents of the file `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf`.
. Replace the contents of the file with the contents listed below. (You will need to replace the contents of the `rootpw` field with your own password or hash.)

This is a basic configuration file with only one database, which we've setup for this example.

The following table describes LDAP configuration file parameters:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Item |Description
|`loglevel` |Specifies logging detail. Level 256 logs connection, operation and results statistics. On this system, by default `slapd` logs to `/var/log/syslog`.
|`modulepath` |Specifies a list of directories to search for loadable modules.
|`moduleload` |Specifies the names of modules to load, which in this case is the `bdb` module for loading a Berkeley database.
|`database` |Marks the beginning of a new database instance definition, starting with the database type.
|`suffix` |The DN suffix of all queries that will be passed to the database.
|`rootdn` |The DN of the root user of the database. This user has full right read-write access to the database. In this example, we employ this user to create entries for console users. The console itself only needs `read access` to the database. It can log in to LDAP as a different user.
|`rootpw` |The password for the database root user. In this case, the file stores an MD5 hash of the password. Passwords can be stored in clear text, but this is a security risk since this configuration file is world-readable. Password hashes can be generated with the `slappasswd command`, as explained below.
|===

 How to generate a hash for the database root user password (optional)

[cols=",",]
|===
|image:/docs/images/icons/emoticons/check.png[image] a|

As shown link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-System-wideLDAPconfigurationfile[above], the LDAP configuration file stores the user name and password for the root user of the database. The password can be stored in clear text; however, this constitutes a security risk, since the LDAP configuration file is world-readable. To generate a hash for the password, run the following command: `slappasswd -h <scheme> -s <secret>`

`<scheme>` is an RFC 2307 scheme such as \{MD5}, \{CRYPT} or \{SSHA} (the default), and `<secret>` is the secret to hash. If invoked with no arguments, the command prompts for the secret and outputs the resulting \{SSHA} hash.

The output of this command should be similar to the following: \{`MD5}Xr4ilOzQ4PCOq3aQ0qbuaQ==`

This output can be copy-pasted into the LDAP configuration file for the `rootpw` field.

|===

==== Test the LDAP server

To test the LDAP server, open a connection to the server and perform a search. To do this, issue the following command:

For this example, the command should return the following output:

==== Create LDAP database entries

At this point, the LDAP server is running and an empty database has been created. We begin populating the database by creating the database root user, which is necessary for log in with Apache Studio and for adding database entries using its graphical interface.

Create a text file with the following text:

[cols=",",]
|===
|image:/docs/images/icons/emoticons/forbidden.png[image] |It is essential to check spacing when working with LDIF files. Be sure to leave only one blank line between entries (and no spaces or tabs in blank lines), and no spaces or tabs at the beginning or end of any line of text.

|===

Now, create the initial database entries with the command:

The command will prompt you for the root user's password. Enter the password that you set in the system-wide LDAP configuration file.

This command should return the following output:

At this point, the database root user, with DN “cn=Manager,dc=company,dc=com”, has been defined.

We log in with this user in order to populate the database.

==== Populate the LDAP database

There are two methods for populating the LDAP database: manually defining each database object by means of a graphical user interface, or writing an LDIF file with the database object definitions, then importing the file into LDAP. This example describes both methods:

link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-PopulatingtheLDAPdatabaseusingaGUI[Populating the LDAP database using a GUI (Apache Studio)] +
 link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-PopulatingtheLDAPdatabasebyimportinganLDIFfile[Populating the LDAP database by importing an LDIF file]

===== Populating the LDAP database using a GUI (Apache Studio)

====== Launch Apache Studio

Navigate to the directory where you decompressed the Apache Studio gzipped tar file. Open a terminal window and type:

For example:

[cols=",",]
|===
|image:/docs/images/icons/emoticons/check.png[image] |When using the terminal, pressing the Tab key will usually auto-complete the folder and file names.

|===

Once in the directory, issue the following command:

Apache Studio's Welcome screen (usually a blank screen) appears.

In order to begin populating the database, you must first create a connection to the database, which you accomplish by completing the following steps:

. Open the *LDAP* menu, then click on *New Connection*. The *Network Parameter* window pops up. +
 +
 image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/1-conn.parameters.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514009545[image]

. Fill in the required fields:
* *Connection name*: Specify any meaningful name. For this example, we use `local`.
* *Hostname*: Hostname or IP address of the LDAP server. In this example, it's on localhost, `127.0.0.1`.
* *Port*: In this example, port `389` (default for LDAP).
* *Encryption method*: `No encryption`.
. To test the connection, click on *Check Network Parameter*, then click *Next*.

[cols=",",]
|===
|image:/docs/images/icons/emoticons/check.png[image] a|

If you experience connection problems while trying to establish a connection to an LDAP server on a different host, issue a telnet command to port `389` on the LDAP host by running the following command: `telnet <host> <port>`

For example:

If the connection is successful, output should resemble the following:

On the other hand, a `Connection refused` error indicates that nothing is listening on the specified port. Any other result may indicate a network issue, such as a firewall between your machine and the LDAP host.

|===

After setting network parameters, the wizard takes you to the *Authentication* window:

image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/2-auth_user.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514165533[image]

Enter the required information:

*Authentication Method*: `Simple authentication`. +
 *Bind DN or user*: The root user of the database, as defined on the LDAP configuration file and created with the LDIF import described above. In this case, **cn=Manager,dc=company,dc=com**. +
 *Bind password*: The password for the database root user, as defined on the LDAP configuration file.

Click *Check Authentication* to verify authentication, then click *Finish*.

Apache Directory Studio is now connected to the LDAP server. The *LDAP Browser* pane displays a top-level entry called *DIT* (Directory Information Tree). Click the arrow next to *DIT* to expand the contents of the database. At this point, the database only contains one object: the root user, Manager.

image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/4-initial_DB_objects.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514173737[image]

===== Creating organizational units

We create two organizational units (ou): *groups*, for storing group definitions; and *people*, for storing user definitions.

. In the *LDAP Browser* pane, right-click the domain entry for the database, **dc=company,dc=com**.
. On the pop-up menu, click *New*, then select *New Entry*.
. In the *Entry Creation Method* window, click *Create entry from scratch*, then click *Next*. The wizard takes you to the *Object Classes* window: +
 +
 image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/5-create_obj_wizard-ob_classes.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514180322[image]

. In the *Available object classes* input box, begin typing *OrganizationalUnit*. The search box automatically selects available objects that match your search. +
 +
 image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/6-create_obj_wizard-ob_classes.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514187128[image]

. Click *OrganizationalUnit*.
. Click *Add*, then click *Next*. The next window is the *Distinguished Name* window: +
 +
 image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/7-create_obj_wizard-DN.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514192640[image]

. In the *RDN* field, enter *ou*, then press *Enter*.
. In the *=* field, enter *groups*. When you do so, the *DN Preview* window fills automatically with the *Distinguished Name* of the entry you are creating, in this case `ou=groups,dc=company,dc=com`.
. Click *Next*. The wizard takes you to the *Attributes* pop-up window: +
 +
 image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/8-create_obj_wizard-attrs.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514197234[image] +

 +
 The window displays the list of attributes of the object just created.
.Click *Finish* to write the changes to the LDAP database. An object of type OrganizationalUnit called `groups`, with DN `ou=groups,dc=company,dc=com`, is created, and it appears in the *LDAP Browser* pane.

Repeat the above process, creating a new OrganizationalUnit object called *people*.

===== Creating users

At this point, the LDAP database contains the root user plus two empty organizational units called `groups` and `people`. We next create the entries for three users, all under the `people` organizational unit.

|testuser1 |This is a console user with limited permissions, created for this example.
|===

The procedure for creating users is the same as that for creating groups. The values (object type and attributes) differ, of course.

. Right-click the *ou=people* entry in the LDAP tree, select *New*, then *New Entry*.
. In the *Object Classes* window, select *inetOrgPerson*, then click *Next*.
. In the *Distinguished Name* window, type `cn` into the *RDN* field, then press *Enter*.
. In the *=* field, enter `mmc`. When you do so, the *DN Preview* window should fill automatically with the *Distinguished Name* of the entry you are creating, in this case `cn=mmc,ou=people,dc=company,dc=com`.
. Press *Next*.
. When the *Attributes* window prompts you to specify a value for the *sn* field, right-click the *sn* field, then select *Edit Value*. Type *mmc*, then click *Finish*.

The `mmc` user has been created with the following attributes:

* objectClass: `inetOrgPerson`
* objectClass: `organizationalPerson`
* objectClass: `person`
* objectClass: `top`
* cn: `mmc`
* sn: `mmc`

You must add two more attributes:

uid: `mmc` +
 userPassword: `mmc123`

. To add these attributes, click the *New Attribute* icon (highlighted below). +

. In the *Attribute Type* window input box, type `uid` (or select *uid* from the drop-down menu by clicking the arrow to the right of the input box).
. Click *Next*, then *Finish*.
. Type *mmc*, then press *Enter*.
. Click on the *New Attribute* icon again, then type or select *userPassword*.
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Options* window, click *Finish*. +
 +
 image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/10-create_obj_wizard-user_pass.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514208811[image]

. When prompted for the new password, type *mmc123* (or another password of your choice; you will have to specify this same password in the console's `mmc-ldap.properties` file) in the *Enter New Password* field.
. In the *Select Hash Method* menu, select *Plaintext*, then click *OK*.

User `mmc` has now been defined with all the attributes that will be employed in this example configuration.

Repeat the above procedure to create users *admin* and *testuser1*, assigning the passwords of your choice. These passwords will be entered by the users when logging into the console.

===== Creating and Defining the Administrators Group

. On the *LDAP Browser* pane, right-click on the *ou=groups* entry in the directory tree.
. Select *New*, then *New Entry*.
. Following the same procedure for creating organizational units and users, define an entry with the following attributes:
* objectClass: `groupOfNames`
* cn: `Administrators`
* `member: cn=admin,ou=people,dc=company,dc=com`

After you have defined the *cn* attribute, the object creation wizard prompts you to enter a value for the *member* attribute. This is the DN of the user that will belong to the `Administrators` group. You can either type the DN of the user (see above) or click *Browse* to select the user from the database:

image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/11-create_obj_wizard-groupmember.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514217263[image]

As you can see, group membership is not stored with the user's definition, but with the definitions of the groups to which the user belongs. If you want more than one user to belong to the group, use the *New Attribute* icon, (see above) to add more attributes to the group, completing these steps as well:

. select *member* as the attribute type.
. select the additional user that will be a member of the group.

When a user logs in to the console, the console first asks the LDAP server to verify the user name and password, and then requests a list of the groups that the user belongs to. The parameters for this search are defined in the following line on the `mmc-ldap.properties` file:

===== Creating and defining a test user and group

Following the procedures outlined above, create a user called *testuser1* and a group called *testgroup*, with `testuser1` as member of the group.

==== Configure the console for LDAP

Follow the procedure outlined link:#EnablingLDAPAuthentication-EnablingLDAPontheconsole[above] to Enable LDAP on the console. For this example, the contents of the `mmc-ldap.properties` file are as follows:

===== Test console logins

Start the console and log in as user *admin*, using the password set in LDAP when creating the user. Since user `admin` is a member of the Administrators group, the console has given the user the default set of full administrative permissions for the group. On log in, the console displays the Dashboard, which exposes full functionality for members of the group.

Once logged in to the console, verify that the console has correctly read all users from the LDAP server. To do this, click *Administration*. You should see a list of all the users created on the LDAP database, in this case, `mmc`, `admin` and `testuser1`.

image:/docs/download/attachments/87687457/12-mmc-userlist.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339514222623[image]

Create a group called *testgroup*:

. Navigate to the *Manage* pane on the left-hand side of the screen.
. Click *User Groups*.
. Click *New*on the right hand of the screen, then enter:
* group *Name*
* *Description* (if desired)
* set the permissions.

For this test group, set the following permissions:

*Applications - View* +
 *Deployments - View* +
 *Flows - View* +
 *Tracking - View* +
 *Files - View* +
 *Servers - View*

*Server Group Permissions*: All

Log out of the console, then log back in as *testuser1*. The console displays the Dashboard, but with limited options matching the limited permissions of group `testgroup`:

==== Where to Go from Here

You can create new users and groups on LDAP and assign members to the groups. Then, on the console, set the desired permissions for each group. You can then remove the `Administrators` group from LDAP, if desired.

=== Alternative Method of Populating the LDAP Database: Importing an LDIF file

To automatically create database objects in LDAP, you first define the objects in an LDIF file, then import the file into LDAP with the `ldapadd` command.

Below you will find the LDIF file for all of the database user and group objects created in this example. If you wish to automatically replicate this user and group configuration into your LDAP database, copy-paste the below code into a plain text file, then import the file with the command:

You may wish to modify the `userPassword` values before importing.

LDIF file contents:

=== Basic Logging of LDAP Events

By default, the LDAP server logs events to `/var/log/syslog`. In case of authentication issues, check this log for details.

Below is an extract of the log, showing events logged by `slapd` when a user logs into the console. There are two `BIND` operations (user authentications) to the LDAP server; the first occurs when the console starts and authenticates itself (See: the second and third lines in the extract below). After establishing the context base for searching, LDAP searches for `user admin`, authenticates the user, then searches for the groups the user belongs to.
