The Mule agent is a plugin extension for Mule which exposes the Mule API. Using the Mule agent, you can monitor and control your Mule ESB servers by calling APIs from external systems, and/or have Mule publish its own data to external systems. The agent has many features, including:

* Controlling applications, domains and services:
** List, deploy, undeploy or redeploy domains
** List, deploy, undeploy, get status of, start or stop applications
* Publishing Mule metrics to external monitoring systems

The agent supports two communication protocols: REST and WebSockets. 

The agent is installed into your `$MULE_HOME/plugins` directory; it is configured via a single configuration file. For installation instructions and download links, see link:/docs/display/current/Installing+Mule+Agent[Installing the Agent].

Additionally, MuleSoft provides several open source agent modules. These are provided as is, and receive no support for MuleSoft. To access these modules, check the GitHub repositories:
