= Shortcuts to Success

image:/docs/download/thumbnails/98310309/shortcut_icon.png?version=1&modificationDate=1389629513910[image]Designed as pathways for learning in the MuleSoft documentation, the *Shortcuts to Success* materials provide prescriptive reading lists and use-case specific examples to facilitate quick absorption of content. Better than browsing through our extensive documentation, or searching by keyword, the Shortcuts aim to help you complete a particular task in the shortest time possible. More "checklist" than "dense prose", these developer-focused materials aim to get you from "zero" to "deployed" in a matter of hours.
