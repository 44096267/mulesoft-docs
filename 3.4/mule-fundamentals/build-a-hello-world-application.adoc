= Build a Hello World Application

It's time to roll up your sleeves and build your first Mule Studio application!

As the objective of this quick tutorial is get something built and running fast, this document doesn't spend much time explaining components. More detailed explanations and concepts exist in the link:/docs/display/34X/First+Day+with+Mule[First Day with Mule] and link:/docs/display/34X/First+Week+with+Mule[First Week with Mule] sections of the link:/docs/display/34X/Mule+Fundamentals[Mule Fundamentals], but for now, let's just see Mule work: you're about to build a very simple application in Studio, deploy it to Studio's embedded server, then interact with the application through a Web browser.

== Assumptions

This tutorial assumes that you have link:/docs/display/34X/Download+and+Launch+Mule+Studio[downloaded, installed and launched Mule Studio],  and that you've read through the link:/docs/display/34X/Mule+Studio+Essentials[Mule Studio Essentials].

== Creating a New Project

. In Studio, click *File* then select *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Studio opens the *New Mule Project* wizard. In the *Name* field, enter the value *`My First Project`,* then click *Finish*. +

+

. Studio opens a blank canvas.  Begin designing your project by dragging and dropping an *HTTP Endpoint* from the *palette* onto the *canvas*. Notice that Studio automatically wraps the endpoint with a *flow*, thus saving you the step of manually creating one.  +

+

+

. Add to your flow with an *Echo Component*, dragging it next to the HTTP Endpoint on the canvas. Click the *Configuration XML* tab (at the base of the canvas) to see your application represented in XML. Studio's two-way editing functionality ensures that anything you add or change in the graphical interface is reflected in the XML config. (Use the tabs below to see both the graphical and XML representations of the application.)

....

. Click the *Message Flow* tab to return to the graphical editor, then click the *save* icon to save your project. 

== Configuring the Project

Now that you've modeled a basic application in Studio, you can take the steps to configure each individual element. 

. Click the HTTP Endpoint on the canvas to open its *Properties Editor* in the console (see image below).
. The HTTP endpoint allows your Mule application to connect to Web resources through the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. In a more complex application, you would use this editor to configure values for the endpoint's attributes so as to define the connection details for your application. For this project, keep the default values for all fields. +

+

. Click the *Echo Component* on the canvas to open its *Properties Editor* in the console (see image below).
. The Echo Component simply returns the message payload in response to the HTTP request. For this project, keep the default values for all fields. +

+

+

. Once again, you can click the *Configuration XML* to view your changes in the XML config (see code below). Click the *save* icon to save your changes.

== Deploying the Project

Mule Studio comes bundled with its own embedded server, ideal for testing deployments as you code. You can deploy your application on the embedded server to see it working and perform any debugging activities before deploying to a production environment such as an on premise server or link:#[CloudHub].

. In the *Package Explorer*, right click the project name, then select *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. Studio launches the application on the embedded server, displaying its actions in the console. When complete, the console message reads *`Started app ' my_first_project '`*

== Interacting with the Project

. Open a Web browser. 
. Navigate to your application's URL, appending it with a string that becomes the message payload. For example: +
 +
http://localhost:8081/Hello_world

. The application accepts the request via its HTTP endpoint, then "echoes" the same payload as the response in your browser. +

+

+

. In Studio, stop the application from running using the *terminate* icon in the console (see below). +
