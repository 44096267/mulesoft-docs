== Migrating Data from Older Versions of MMC

To successfully upgrade to MMC 3.4.2 from an older version, you will need to migrate data from your old MMC installation in the following scenarios:

* If the old version of MMC uses LDAP for user authentication
* If the old version of MMC persists environment or tracking data to an external databases

In both of the above cases, you need to migrate configuration data in order to retain your settings.

If your current MMC installation does not use LDAP for user authentication and is not configured to persist data on an external database, then you do not need to take further actions for upgrading to MMC 3.4.2.

The following documentation pages provide the steps necessary to migrate data to MMC 3.4.2:

* link:/docs/display/34X/Upgrading+to+MMC+3.4.2+with+LDAP[Upgrading to MMC 3.4.2 with LDAP]
