= The Servers Tab

In Runtime Manager, a server is a Mule runtime or API Gateway runtime instance in a location other than CloudHub. You must first register the runtime in the Runtime ManagerÂ console. Once registered and configured in this tab, you may deploy your applications to it through the link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Applications Tab].

Virtual servers created through Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) are not displayed on this tab.
