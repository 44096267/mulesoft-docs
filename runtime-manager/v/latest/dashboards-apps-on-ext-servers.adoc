For Mule applications that are deployed to your own servers, Runtime Manager dashboards provide graphs on these metrics:

* Error rate
* Response time

If your application runs on a cluster or server group, the aggregated metrics of the entire set of servers included will be charted as a single plot line.
+
By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.

You can also set up alerts on these metrics and get more detailed information on any server groups and clusters that host your applications.
