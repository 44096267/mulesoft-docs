== Overview


Runtime Manager is the link:/anypoint-fundamentals/[Anypoint Platform] tool used to deploy and manage all of your Mule applications in one central location, whether your apps are running in the cloud or on-premises.

After you have created a Mule application (for example, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/build-a-hello-world-application[Hello World Mule application]), you can deploy it to run in the cloud or on-premises. Runtime Manager is designed specifically for handling Mule runtime instances, and can do so in various environments, providing comprehensive functionality for managing Mule apps in CloudHub virtual workers, servers, server groups, clusters, allowing you to work with the applications (and the application's flows) running on Mule instances.

Runtime Manager provides a dashboard that indicates the status of every deployed app and monitored server, with a rich set of features you can use to manage and track activity of your running applications.

[INFO]
For managing apps on your own servers, you can still resort to the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/index[Mule Management Console] as an alternative to the Runtime Manager. This tool is no longer being developed, but has some features that are currently not yet implemented in the Runtime Manager for on-premise deployment scenarios.
