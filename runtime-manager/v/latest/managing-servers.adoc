= About Servers, Server Groups, and Clusters
:keywords: cloudhub, application, server, server group, on-premise, runtime manager, arm, cluster, clusters

Using Runtime Manager, you can register and set up the properties of servers, server groups, and clusters that reside on-premises. Once these are set up, you can select them as the deployment target for your applications, as an alternative to deploying to CloudHub.

== Using Clusters vs Server Groups

Both clusters and server groups run applications in multiple distributed nodes, the difference lies in that in a server group, instances of the applications are completely isolated from each other, whilst on a cluster its nodes are aware one another and share common information and synchronize statuses.

For a detailed explanation of the benefits of clusters, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-high-availability-ha-clusters[Mule High Availability Clusters].


*NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH THE FOLLOWING. NEED TO VERIFY IF THEY ARE COVERED ELSEWHERE*

== Starting a Mule or API Gateway runtime

. Start your Mule runtime or API Gateway runtime. To do so, open a terminal and change directory to the MuleSoft `bin` directory:
** For Mule runtime: Run `./mule`
** For API Gateway runtime: Run `./gateway` or `./gateway start`. The first command retains the gateway process in the terminal foreground; when you want to stop the gateway, press `CTRL-C`. If you are running API Gateway runtime in the foreground, your terminal fills with startup messages.

. In the *Servers* screen of Runtime Manager, your server's status changes first toÂ *Connected*, then to *Running:*

[TIP]
See a full reference for server statuses in link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications#status-states[Status States].

At this point, you have successfully added server `srv1`.

== Restart an Application on a Server

You can restart an application that is currently running on a server from the drop-down menu in the status menu:

== Stopping an Application on a Server

To stop an application that is currently running on a server:

. Click a server entry to display the detail view on the right side of the screen.
. Select *Stop* from the drop-down menu in the Status menu:

== Alerts

You can set up email alerts that are sent whenever certain events occur to your servers, such as a server being disconnected, or a server being removed from a cluster. These alerts may be linked to a specific server or to all of them. See link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts] for instructions on how to do this.
