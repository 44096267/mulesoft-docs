Runtime Manager provides dashboards for servers outside of Cloudhub that host Mule applications.The dashboard contains several metrics divided into two panes:

* Overview
* Breakdown

image:monitoring-dashboards-server.png[]

To access the dashboard of a server on-premises:

. Select a server in the *Servers* page to open the side panel.
. Click the *View Details* button.
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left.
. Select the time interval to graph.
+

+
By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.
+

+
. To get metrics on individual applications running on a server that hosts multiple applications, select the applications you want to examine.
+

The metrics will appear in a side panel.

[TIP]
====
If the server has an issue, click the icon on the *Health* column to access the dashboard directly.

Note that you can also drill down to this dashboard if you first open <<The Dashboard for a Cluster or Server Group>> that contains the server, and from there then click on the hyperlink on the name of the server.

[TIP]
You can also set up alerts on these metrics in Runtime Manager.

== Metrics in the Server Dashboard

The graphs in this dashboard cover different metrics related to memory and CPU usage. You can see these two at a high level on the *Overview* tab, or you can dig into the *Breakdown* to see a detailed series of metrics that tracks each part of the memory separately.


At a high level, memory can be thought of as divided into what’s in the JVM heap and what’s outisde of it.

The “heap” is the area where all Java objects reside. The heap is created when the JVM is started up, it can be scaled up or down in size without interrupting the applications in it. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection, objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

The non-heap memory stores per-class structures such as a runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods and constructors.

The graphs in this dashboard that display memory usage levels, in both the ‘overview’ and the ‘breakdown’ tabs, track the following three values:

* Used - The amount of memory (in MB) that is currently in use
* Committed - The amount of memory (in MB) guaranteed to be available for use by the Java VM. This amount may change over time. The amount of committed memory will always be greater than or equal to the amount of used memory.
* Total - The maximum amount of memory (in MB) that can be used. This amount may change or be undefined. A memory allocation may fail if the Java VM attempts to increase the used memory to be greater than committed memory, even if the amount used is below the total.


== Heap Memory

This metric found in the *Overview tab* refers to the total Heap memory usage in MB. Refer to the <<Breakdown Tab>> for details about each of its component.

* Heap Memory Usage
* Heap Commited Memory
* Total Memory


== CPU

This metric found in the *Overview tab* refers to total CPU usage of the server, as a percentage.

image:monitoring-dashboards-cpu.png[]

* CPU Usage
* System Available Processing power.
* System Load Average.

[NOTE]
Not available in Windows.



== Thread Count

This graph displays the number of individual threads over time.

image:monitoring-dashboards-threads.png[]

Threads here refer to threads of execution in Java. The JVM allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.


== Garbage Collection


The JVM implements the garbage collection mark-and-sweep algorithm, which consists of two phases.
In the first phase, called the mark phase, finds and marks all accessible objects. In the second phase, the garbage collection algorithm scans through the heap and reclaims all the unmarked objects. This phase is called the sweep phase.

image:monitoring-dashboards-garbage.png[]

* MarkSweep Time.
* MarkSweep Count.
* Par New Time.
* Par New Count.

== Class Loading


The class loading graph shows the amount of classes that are currently loaded or being loaded in total across all apps in the JVM.

image:monitoring-dashboards-classloading.png[]

* Total classes loaded since JVM start.
* Currently loaded classes.
* Unloaded Classes.

== Heap Memory Metrics

The following metrics relate to the portion of the server memory that makes up the JVM Heap:


== Par Eden / Eden Space

The pool in the Heap Space from which memory is initially allocated for most objects.

image:monitoring-dashboards-eden.png[]

* Par Eden Usage.
* Par Eden Total.
* Par Eden Committed.


== Par Survivor / Survivor Space

The pool in the Heap containing objects that have survived the garbage collection of the Eden space.

image:monitoring-dashboards-survivor.png[]

* Par Survivor Usage.
* Par Survivor Total.
* Par Survivor Committed.


== Tenured Generation

The pool in the Heap containing objects that have existed for some time in the survivor space.

image:monitoring-dashboards-tenure.png[]

* Tenured Gen Usage.
* Tenured Gen Total.
* Tenured Gen Committed.


== Non-heap Memory Metrics


The following metrics refer to memory that exists outside the JVM Heap:


== Code Cache

This non-heap space contains memory that is used for compilation and storage of native code.

image:monitoring-dashboards-cahce.png[]

* Code Cache Usage.
* Code Cache Total.
* Code Cache Committed.


== Compressed Class Space

[NOTE]
Only Available when using JDK 8+.

image:monitoring-dashboards-class-space.png[]

* Compressed Class Space Usage.
* Compressed Class Space Total.
* Compressed Class Space Committed.


== Metaspace

JVM memory space that uses native memory for the representation of class metadata.
Only Available when using JDK 8+.

image:monitoring-dashboards-meta.png[]

* Metaspace Usage.
* Metaspace Total.
* Metaspace Commited.


== The Dashboard for a Cluster or Server Group

== Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard of a cluster or a server group on-premises:

. Select a cluster or server group in the *Servers* page to open the side panel.
. Click the *View Details* button.
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left.

////
[TIP]
====
If the cluster or server group has an issue, click the icon on the *Health* column to access the dashboard directly.

== Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard shows three separate metrics:

* CPU usage, as a percentage of the capacity
* Memory usage, in MB
* Heap total, in MB

image::monitoring-dashboards-5cd3c.png[]

All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cbd92.png[]

The aggregated metrics of the entire set of servers included will be charted as a single plot line on the main set of graphs.

You can break down this information into either individual servers or individual applications, note the two tabs that allow you to pick a perspective:

image::monitoring-dashboards-6fe9f.png[]

Then, select one or many servers or applications, and a side-panel will display on the right with this data.

From this menu, you can also click on an individual server name to be taken to the dashboard page for <<The Dashboard for a Server, that individual server>>.
