= To Update a Mule Application
:keywords: runtime manager, anypoint platform, private cloud

You can update a Mule application through the Runtime Manager UI by uploading a zip file that packages the application.

Note that the zip file can be exported to a local machine from Anypoint Studio (as a Mule Deployable Archive) or from Design Center (through Export to Studio).

[[navigate_to_runtime_manager_settings]]

. Click Choose File to upload the zip file from a local drive.

Runtime Manager will attempt to start the updated application after you upload it.

Note that you can also change any Runtime Manager settings for the application from here.

== Updating Your Application

If you made changes to your applications and would like to upload a new version, click *Choose file* on the Deployment screen for that application. The new filename appears in italicized text. Click *Apply changes* to use the new file for deployment. Within a few seconds, your application successfully redeploys. While redeploying, the application status indicator changes to blue, and then turns green after the deployment completes. For applications deployed to CloudHub, you can click *Logs* to see a live redeployment of your application.

[TIP]
If you're deploying your application to a cluster on-premises, Runtime Manager installs the new app version progressively on each server to keep the service working with no downtime throughout the process.
