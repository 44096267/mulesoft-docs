[NOTE]
Dashboards is a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. It is not available for applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to local servers. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-applications[Monitoring Applications] for more details.

The Dashboard gives you in-depth visibility into usage metrics about both your deployed applications and the systems they're deployed to.

The Dashboard helps you answer questions about your integrated apps, such as:

* When did peaks in usage occur?
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on response time?
* How well is the processing power behind my app coping with these peaks?

////
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on message fail rate?
* What impact do high traffic peaks of other applications running on the same server have on the performance of a given application?
////


Using the *Dashboard*, you can view the evolution of metrics about your apps. Going further, you can drill down to the link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insight] section of each app to investigate the fate of individual transactions to help you analyze the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance with company procedures.


== The Dashboard for Apps on CloudHub

=== Access the Dashboard

To access a CloudHub app's dashboard:

. Select an application in the *Applications* page to open the side pannel
. Click the *Manage Application* button
+

. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left

=== Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard shows graphs for three separate metrics:

* Mule Messages
* CPU usage
* Memory usage

All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

If your application runs on multiple workers at a time, they will be charted as different curves on the same graphs, differentiated by different colors.

By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.

[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-cloudhub-applications[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.

== The Dashboard for Apps on Servers

=== Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard of an on-premises app:

. Select an application in the *Applications* page to open the side pannel
. Click the *Manage Application* button
+
image::dashboards-a2810.png[]
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left

You can also drill down to this dashboard if you first open <<The Dashboard for a Server>> that runs the application, and from there then click on the hyperlink on the name of the application.

mule messages
error rate
response time


[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-locally-deployed-applications[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.

== The Dashboard for a Server

=== Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard of a server on-premises:

. Select a server in the *Servers* page to open the side pannel
. Click the *View Details* button
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left

[TIP]
====
If the server has an issue, click the icon on the *Health* column to access the dashboard directly.

what apps


clarify that clicking on an application opens up the side pannel with the graphs for that specific app plus response time/mule messages

you can see multiple applications at the same time w the checkboxes

[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.

== The Dashboard for a Cluster or Server Group

=== Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard of a cluster or a server group on-premises:

. Select a cluster or server group in the *Servers* page to open the side pannel
. Click the *View Details* button
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left

[TIP]
====
If the cluster or server group has an issue, click the icon on the *Health* column to access the dashboard directly.

what servers

with clusters or server groups, you can select a cluster or server to see details of that server on the side pannel

in cluster or server group, click on an individual server NAME to be taken to the single server page, to see apps on it


[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.
