= About Clusters

A Cluster is a set of servers that act as a single deployment target, in which instances of the application are aware of one another and share common information and synchronize statuses. An on-premise cluster enables up to 8 servers to participate in a high availability processing unit so that in case one server should fail, another server takes over processing applications. A cluster can run multiple applications.

Before creating a  cluster, you must create each of the Mule runtimes that are part of the cluster. You must download and installing the same version of the Mule runtime. The minimum Mule version that supports this feature is Mule version 3.7.0 and newer. The minimum Runtime Manager Agent version that supports this feature is Agent version 1.1.1 and newer.

You must also create each of the servers that connect your Mule runtimes to Runtime Manager.
