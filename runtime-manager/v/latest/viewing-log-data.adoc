You can set up, view, and perform searches for Mule application logs through the Runtime Manager UI on CloudHub.

CloudHub stores logs of up to 100 MB per application and per worker or for up to 30 days, whichever limit occurs first.

CloudHub stores log data in Universal Time (UTC). However, the console displays the log using your computer's local time zone. 

Note that after you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the UI.
