= To Configure ELK to Use API Analytics

ELK combines three open source tools (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) that work together to help you store, search and analyze log data. You can output the Mule event notifications as generic system logs, which can be handled by your ELK stack. Logstash captures and indexes the data into the log, from which you can then use Elastisearch and Kibana to generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.
The Agent helps you store all of the Event Notifications produced from the Mule runtime flows into a configurable log file with a rolling file policy.
