= About Server Groups and Clusters

== Clusters vs Server Groups

Both clusters and server groups run applications in multiple distributed nodes, the difference lies in that in a server group, instances of the applications are completely isolated from each other, whilst on a cluster its nodes are aware one another and share common information and synchronize statuses.

For a detailed explanation of the benefits of clusters, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-high-availability-ha-clusters[Mule High Availability Clusters].
