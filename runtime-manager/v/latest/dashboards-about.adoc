Dashboards provide in-depth visibility into usage metrics about both your deployed applications and the systems they're deployed to.

To view data metrics in the dashboards for your applications, you must have these Runtime Manager permissions:

* Read Application
* Read Servers

Dashboards help you answer questions about your integrated apps, such as:

* When did peaks in usage occur?
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on response time?
* How well is the processing power behind my app coping with these peaks?
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on message fail rate?
* What impact do high traffic peaks of other applications running on the same server have on the performance of a given application?
