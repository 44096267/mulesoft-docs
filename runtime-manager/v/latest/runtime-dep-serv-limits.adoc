= About Deployment and Server Limits per Environment

To ensure platform stability and performance, Anypoint Platform has limits on the number of deployments or servers you can create. These limits are specific to an environment or business group. If you need to create additional deployments or servers beyond these limits, you can use different accounts or business groups.
