For Mule applications that are deployed to Cloudhub, Runtime Manager dashboards graph these metrics:

* Mule Messages
* CPU usage, as a percentage of the capacity
* Memory usage

To view a Dashboard for an application:

. Log in and navigate to Runtime Manager.
. Select the application you want to monitor.
+
This action opens the configuration panel.
+
. Click Manage Application in the configuration panel.
+
This action opens a menu on the left.
+
. Select Dashboard from the left menu.
. Select the time interval to graph.

+
Note that if your application runs on multiple workers, the workers will be charted as different curves on the same graphs.
+
By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.

[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-cloudhub-applications[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.
