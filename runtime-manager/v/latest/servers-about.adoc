= About Servers

Using Runtime Manager, you can register and set up the properties of servers, server groups, and clusters that reside on-premises. Once these are set up, you can select them as the deployment target for your applications, as an alternative to deploying to CloudHub.

Runtime Manager provides a single management interface where you can manage applications running in the cloud, on local servers, on server groups that are on-premises within your data center, or on clusters of servers. Applications that are on-premises run on Mule runtime instances on a single server or on a group of servers.

== Getting Started

Runtime Manager has two main tabs, *Applications* and *Servers*.

=== Applications Tab

In Runtime Manager, an application is a Mule Application that is running on a Mule runtime instance. The instance can be running on CloudHub, on an on-premise server of your organization, on a group of servers, or on a cluster. For server groups, an application deployed to the group runs separately on each of the servers, but it's displayed as a single unit on this console.

From the *Applications* tab, by selecting an entry as shown, you can perform these tasks:

* Deploy an Application
* Start, Stop, and Delete an Application
* Manage an Application

For more on the options offered by this tab, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Managing Deployed Applications].

=== Servers Tab

In Runtime Manager, a server is a Mule runtime or API Gateway runtime instance in a location other than CloudHub. You must first register the runtime in the Runtime ManagerÂ console. Once registered and configured in this tab, you may deploy your applications to it through the link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications[Applications Tab].

Virtual servers created through Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) are not displayed on this tab.

=== Switching Environments

If you have multiple environments in your organization, you can switch between them. From any screen in the CloudHub platform, you can switch to a different environment by clicking the current environment name, displayed in the upper left corner of the screen, and picking another environment.

. Click the current environment in the top left corner of your Anypoint Platform UI
. Select the environemnt you want to switch to
. Click the *switch* button

Both servers and applications are always associated to a particular environment, and you won't be able to see these until you switch to the right environment.
