The Runtime Manager UI provides notifications about the status of your applications. Notifications come from alerts and from TODO...

== To View Notifications
. Log in and navigate to Runtime Manager.
. Click the red bell icon on the top right of the page, for example:

+
Note that emailed alerts provide a link to the same page in the Runtime Manager UI.

If you do not see notifications that you expect, you can check that you are in the correct environment, for example, your Production environment and not the Sandbox.

Note that you can also view alerts through the Alerts page in the Runtime Manager UI.

== Standard Notifications

For applications deployed to *CloudHub*, certain events that may occur to one of your applications will automatically produce a notification:


[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Event |Message
| Worker will restart | A worker <ip> has become unresponsive. Restarting the worker.
| Worker has restarted | Restart SUCCEEDED for worker <ip>.
| Worker restart failed | Restart FAILED for worker <ip>.
| Maximum Restarts attempted for a worker| We've reached the maximum amount of restart attempts.
| Worker needs restarting, but restarts are disabled | A worker <ip> has become unresponsive. Restarts are disabled.
|===



== Custom Notifications

On applications that are deployed to CloudHub, you can create custom notifictions using the *CloudHub connector* that must priorly exist in your application.



. Download the *CloudHub connector* from the link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange]
+

. Place an instance of the *CloudHub connector* in one of your project's flows, to be triggered when something meaningful happens
. Configure the connector. In the *Operation* field select *Create Notification* and then set the Domain, Message and Priority for it.

+
You should now be receiving notifications from here

. You may also want to set up email alerts to inform you when one of these custom events occurs. For setting up these alerts, see link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts on Runtime Manager]. You must create an alert of type *Custom Notification Alert* that matches your custom notification.

See theÂ link:/runtime-manager/custom-application-alerts[Custom Application Alerts] tutorial.

== Notification Retention

Notifications are retained by Anypoint Platform within the bounds of the following limits, whatever happens first:

* for 30 days
* up to 1000 notifications per application
