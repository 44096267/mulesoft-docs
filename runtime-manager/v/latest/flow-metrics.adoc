You can view the evolution of performance metrics for individual flows in your applications that are deployed to servers on premises.

== Access Flow Metrics

[NOTE]
To view flow metrics, your user must have `Read Application` permission for the desired applications.

. Enter a running application's settings (either by clicking the *Manage Application* button on the side panel, or the application name itself in the table).
. Select the *Flows* tab on the left side bar
. Select one or multiple flows

== Verify the Status of Servers

If your application is deployed to a Cluster or a Server Group, you can view the status of the flow on each server it runs in.

== View Flow Metrics

Once you have selected one or multiple flows, you can view the *Metrics* tab. This tab contains charts for the following three metrics:

* Mule messages per minute
* Errors per minute
* Flow response time

All metrics are displayed as an average.



== Navigating the Metrics

All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

If your application runs on a cluster or server group, the aggregated metrics of the entire set of servers included will be charted as a single plot line.

By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.

[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-cloudhub-applications[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.
