You can download logs and diagnostics on the workers that run your Mule application. This data is available through the Runtime Manager UI on CloudHub.

Diagnostics display the Java thread dump of each worker. They indicate the current state of the server, which is useful for debugging and support.

Note that for applications running on a Mule version prior to 3.8.0 (excluding version 3.7.4) diagnostics are not available.
