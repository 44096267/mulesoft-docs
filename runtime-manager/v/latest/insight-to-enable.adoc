You can set up the Insight troubleshooting tool for Mule apps that are deployed to Cloudhub or to on-premises servers. After you enable Insight, the following events are tracked by default:

* Data that passes through endpoints (inbound and outbound) in your Mule applications
* Flow initiation and completion
* Any custom business events embedded in your Mule flows

To extend the default set of Mule application events that you can troubleshoot with Insight, you can embed Custom Business Event elements and configure message processors in your flow to perform granular event tracking.

Note that logs for applications deployed to servers on-premises contain event information only, without any message contents.

To set up Insight for Mule apps deployed to servers on-premises:

. Contact your MuleSoft sales representative to obtain special entitlements on your account.
. Follow the procedure for setting up Insight for apps on Cloudhub.

To set up Insight for apps on CloudHub:

[[navigate_to_runtime_manager_settings]]
include::manage-include-navigate-to-settings.adoc[]
. In the Settings menu, select the *Insight* tab:

. Select one of the tracking options:
+
** Disabled - to not use Insight.
** Metadata - to simply track events.
** Metadata and Replay (CloudHub only) - to track events and enable the ability to instantly replay a transaction from the console. For more information, seeÂ Diagnosing Problems and Replaying Transactions. Note that replay only works for flows that have inbound endpoints.
