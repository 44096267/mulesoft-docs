Insight tracks a default set of events and any events from Insight-compatible components in your app flows. Because Insight significantly impacts the performance of your apps, you should enable and use it only as needed.

Before you begin:

* Make sure that Insight data storage in the Amazon S3 bucket in `us-east1` does not violate any of your compliance requirements.

* To use Insight on Mule apps that are deployed to your own servers (not on CloudHub), you need to contact your MuleSoft sales representative to obtain special entitlements on your account.
