= To Get Alerts on Mule App and Server Events
:keywords: cloudhub, management, analytics, runtime manager, arm

In the Runtime Manager UI, you can set up alerts that that notify you by email and through the Runtime Manager UI each time a specified event occurs. You can also edit, delete, duplicate, enable, and disable alerts. Your alerts can apply to one or more applications or servers. However, a single alert cannot span applications that are on both CloudHub and local servers. You must create two separate alerts to reach both types.

* Standard alerts - Runtime Manager includes a number of alert conditions (such as Deployment Failed, Deployment Success, Worker Not Responding, Server Deleted, Server Disconnected) that you can use to trigger alerts for Mule apps and servers.
* Custom alerts - For Mule apps, you can also specify your own custom alerts from the Runtime Manager UI. Custom alerts require you to use the CloudHub connector on your Mule application. Installation and reference documentation for the connector is available on Anypoint Exchange.

== To View Alert Notifications
. Log in and navigate to Runtime Manager.
. Click the red bell icon on the top right of the page, for example:

Note that emailed alerts provide a link to the same page in the Runtime Manager UI.

If you do not see notifications that you expect, you can check that you are in the correct environment, for example, your Production environment and not the Sandbox.

More detailed information is available through <<view-alerts>>.
