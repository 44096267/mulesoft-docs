The Runtime Manager UI uses the Insight troubleshooting tool to collect and display data on business transactions and events on your Mule applications. Because this tool significantly impacts the performance of your application, you should use it as needed to find and recover from any errors that occurred during message processing and to replay your transactions instantly.

Insight helps you answer questions about your integrated apps, such as:

* What happened with a particular transaction or synchronization?
* When did the transaction occur? How long did it take?
* What was the result of a transaction?
* If something went wrong during processing, at what point did the failure occur?

Insight provides a view of events that occur within the flows that handle your business transactions and lets you drill down into event-related data that can help you analyze the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance with company procedures.

Insight retains data from the last 100,000 Mule application events for up to 7 days, and it keeps a record (without the Mule message content) of all events from the last 30 days.

// TODO: NEED TO VERIFY ALL THIS IS TRUE. AND DECIDE WHAT WE NEED TO SAY.
[NOTE]

* Insight does not support visibility into batch processing.
* Data is stored in an S3 bucket in us-east1, regardless of the region of the app's deployment. Make sure this does not violate any of your compliance requirements.
