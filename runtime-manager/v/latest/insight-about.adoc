In addition to using Mule logs, you can troubleshoot Mule apps that are deployed to CloudHub or to on-premises servers by enabling the Insight troubleshooting tool in the Runtime Manager UI. You use Insight to collect and display data on business transactions and events within your Mule apps. Insight helps you find and recover from any errors that occurred during message processing, and for Mule apps that are deployed to CloudHub, it can also replay your transactions. Insight data can help answer questions like these:

* What happened with a particular transaction or synchronization?
* When did the transaction occur? How long did it take?
* What was the result of a transaction?
* If something went wrong during processing, at what point did the failure occur?

Insight tracks these events by default:

* Data that passes through endpoints (inbound and outbound) in your Mule apps
* Flow initiation and completion
* Any custom business events embedded in your Mule flows

You can extend the set of Mule app events that you troubleshoot with Insight by embedding Custom Business Event elements and configuring message processors in your flow to perform granular event tracking. You can also change default behavior, such as the generation of transaction IDs for transaction-level events.

Insight retains data from the last 100,000 Mule app events for up to 7 days, and it keeps a record (without the Mule message content) of all events from the last 30 days.

The Insight UI provides information at three levels:

* Transactions - Flow-level events that can provide a business view of the system.
* Events - Low-level details of a transaction that map to message processors and endpoints. These events include information about exceptions and any custom business events. You can use it to discover the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance with company procedures.
* Metadata - High-level business events from custom key/value pairs for any custom events for your app.

Notes:

* Insight does not provide visibility into batch processing.
* Event filtering options for viewing transaction details depend on your user role. This example shows Transaction Details menu options:

  ** For the Support role, the menu only displays Custom Events.
  ** For Admin and Developer roles, the menu displays Custom Events, Endpoint Events, and Message Processor Events, but it does not display Flow events.

* Advanced searches include a Business Events filter if your app includes them.
