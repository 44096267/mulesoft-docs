The Runtime Manager UI provides the Insight troubleshooting tool to collect and display data on business transactions and events within your Mule apps. Because Insight significantly impacts the performance of your apps, you should use it only as needed to find and recover from any errors that occurred during message processing and to replay your transactions instantly.

Insight retains data from the last 100,000 Mule application events for up to 7 days, and it keeps a record (without the Mule message content) of all events from the last 30 days.

The Insight UI provides information at three levels:

* Transactions - Flow-level events that can provide a business view of the system.
* Events - Low-level details of a transaction that map to message processors and endpoints. These events include information about exceptions and any custom business events. You can use it to discover the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance with company procedures.
* Metadata - High-level business events from custom key/value pairs for any custom events for your app.

Data from Insight helps answer questions about your integrated apps, such as these:

* What happened with a particular transaction or synchronization?
* When did the transaction occur? How long did it take?
* What was the result of a transaction?
* If something went wrong during processing, at what point did the failure occur?

// TODO: NEED TO VERIFY ALL THIS IS TRUE. AND DECIDE WHAT WE NEED TO SAY.

[NOTE]
--
* Insight does not provide visibility into batch processing.
* Data is stored in an S3 bucket in us-east1, regardless of the region of the app's deployment. Make sure this does not violate any of your compliance requirements.
