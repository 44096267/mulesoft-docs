. Give the cluster a name.

[TIP]
The cluster name must not start or end with a dash, must be at least 3 characters long, no more than 40 characters, must be unique, and contain only letters, numbers, or dashes.

. Choose *Multicast* or *Unicast*. For more information, see <<Multicast Versus Unicast, Multicast Versus Unicast>>.
. Click the checkboxes for the names of the servers to add to your cluster, and click *Create Cluster*.

[NOTE]
====
* None of the servers you select for creating a new cluster can contain any *previously deployed applications*.

* Multicast servers can be in the link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applications#status-states[Status States] 'Running' or 'Disconnected', whereas unicast servers can only be in the state 'Running'. They can't be merely in 'Created' state.

* All servers in a cluster must be running the same *Mule runtime version* and *Agent version*.
