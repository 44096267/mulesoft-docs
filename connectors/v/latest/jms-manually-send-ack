= To Manually Send a JMS Ack

== About Message Acknowledgments

JMS sends an acknowledgement to the publisher of a message to confirm that the message was consumed. The sending of acknowledgements can be handled by the JMS Listener or JMS Consume operation that receives the message, or you can configure these so that this action is carried out "manually" by a separate operation on the same flow.

The manual sending of message acknowledgements can be carried by either of these JMS operations:

* Ack Operation: Performs a single ACK for the message that's being processed. This operation is idempotent, so performing an ACK more than once over the same message doesn't break the execution of the flow.

* Recover Session Operation: Performs a session recover. A session recover automatically redelivers all the consumed messages that have not being acknowledged.


== Manually Send an Ack


To send an acknowledgement responding a message:

. Create a Mule application as a project.

. Add a Listener operation from the JMS Connector to your flow.

. Create a JMS configuration for the connection, leaving all of the fields with their default values.

. Set the Destination to the name of the queue you want to consume messages from.

+
If you want to consume a Topic, change the Consumer Type to Topic.

. Set the Ack Mode to `MANUAL`

. Add a JMS Ack operation on any point of your flow after the JMS Connector.

+
In this way, the acknowledgement is sent only if the flow reaches that point of your flow.
+
You can add a Recover Session operation instead of an Ack operation to send acknowledgements for all consumed messages that havent been acknowledged.

. In the Ack operation, set the Ack Id to reference where this value exists in the incoming Mule message. By default, this is in an attribute named ackId, which can be referenced through the expression `#[attributes.ackId]`.



== XML Examples

The example below shows a listener that is set to handle Acks manually, followed by an Ack operation that performs the sending of the acknowledgement.


[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:listener config-ref="config" destination="${incomingDestination}"
ackMode="MANUAL"/>
<jms:ack ackId="#[attributes.ackId]"/>
----

This second example shows the same listener, with its Acks being handled by a Recover Session operation.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:listener config-ref="config" destination="${incomingDestination}"
ackMode="MANUAL"/>
<jms:recover-session ackId="#[attributes.ackId]"/>
----
