This example creates a Mule flow to get keys from the Incident table in a ServiceNow instance.

. Create a Mule project in your Anypoint Studio and drag a HTTP connector into the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor console.
+
.The HTTP Request configuration sets properties for the HTTP connection: socket properties, proxy settings, and authentication. This simple configuration assumes a default HTTP request configuration. If a different authentication strategy is employed, it can be configured within the advanced configuration of the connector.
+
. Add a new HTTP Listener Configuration global element:
.. In *Connector Configuration*, click the green plus button (*+*).
.. Accept the default parameters: port 8081 and host 0.0.0.0.
.. In the HTTP connector properties, set the path to the `/incident/get` value.
. Configure a new HTTP Requester with BASIC Auth (use the ServiceNow environment credentials)
. Add a Set Payload transformer after the HTTP Requester, and set the value to:
+
[source,code]
#[['description': 'Get Keys Demo']]
+
. Search for `servicenow` and drag the ServiceNow connector after the Set Payload block.
. Configure the ServiceNow connector global element with its environment values.
. Click Validate Config to confirm that Mule can connect with your ServiceNow instance. If the connection is successful, click OK to save the configurations of the global element. If unsuccessful, revise or correct any incorrect parameters, and test again.
+
. In the properties editor of the ServiceNow connector, set the Table to `incident` and the Operation to `getKeys`:

+
. Search for `Dataweave` and drag the Transform Message building block between the Set Payload transformer and the ServiceNow connector, and configure it for transform the XML message
+
. Add an XML to JSON transformer.
. Save and run the project as a Mule Application.
. To test the app, navigate to `+http://localhost:8081/incident/get+`
