= To Configure NetSuite Connector in Design Center
:keywords: netsuite

. In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver for this connector on your file system, and upload it. Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded.
. Click Design Center and click *+ Create*. Specify the project name, type, and environment name. If no environment is present, go to the Access Management section of Anypoint Platform and create a new Design environment.
. Click a trigger. You can create a global element by selecting this connector as they trigger. If a global element is not needed, you can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.
. To create an HTTP global element for the connector, set the Configuration Name to the NetSuite endpoint, the protocol to HTTP or HTTPS, Host to 0.0.0.0 to test on your computer or another IP address where the Mule application listens for  requests, the port to 8081 or another port where the Mule application listens for requests, and the Base Path to /addrecord or a value relative to another operation where the Mule application listens. 
. Click the plus sign to add a component and click NetSuite from the Component list.
. Select an authentication mechanism listed on the Global connector configuration. It can be one of the followings:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Configuration |Description
|Login Authentication |Makes use of the SuiteTalk's login API call on the first request sent by the connector to establish a session with NetSuite.
|Request Based Authentication |Using this strategy, you can send user credentials in the SOAP header of each request instead of authenticating to NetSuite by invoking login.
|Single Sign-On Authentication |This is a token-based authentication system that avoids the use of environment username and password. Here you supply a privateKey together with other information. The connector is then responsible for generating an authentication token and establishing a session with NetSuite via the `ssoLogin` API call on the first request.
|Token Authentication |Similar to Single Sign-On Login Authentication, this is a token-based authentication system. However, instead of using a privateKey generated via OpenSSL, this uses a consumer and token key/secret pairs which are established within the NetSuite environment.

. Configure the fields according your selection as shown in the sections that follow.
. Test the connection.
