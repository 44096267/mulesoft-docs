= To Query a Database

This procedure builds on the previous example of connecting a Mule app to the Classic Models database. You query the database for product information, log the names of product lines, and inspect sample output.

. Add a connector to a new project to trigger an app from a browser. 
. Connect a database to perform an operation, for example, connect a MySQL database to the flow and choose the Select operation.
. Set up the query in the database connector configuration.
* In SQL Query Text, enter a SQL query, omitting the semicolon. For example:
+
`SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3`
+
* Close the connector.
. Log the product line names that are included in the query output: 
* For example, add a logger to the flow.
* In General, type the following message: `payload.` and pause.
+
DataSense displays the database column names and other valid payloads.
+
image:logger-data-sense.png[buyPrice Array(Number), MSRP, productCode, productDescirption, productLine, productName, productScale]
* Select a database column name. For example, `productLine`.
+
`payload.productLine`
. In Design Center, click Run or Update.
. Launch the app: Select Running > Copy Link, open a browser, paste, and go to the URL.
+
. View the log.
+
In the log, the product line names that are included in the query output appear:
+
`INFO  16:03:47  [Motorcycles, Classic Cars, Motorcycles]`
+
. Open the database connector, and select Live > Output.
+
The results of the query appear in JSON format:
+
----
[
  {
	"buyPrice": 48.81,
	"productScale": "1:10",
	"productLine": "Motocycles",
...
  }
]
