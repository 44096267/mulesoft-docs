= To Query a Database

This procedure builds on the previous example that connects a Mule app to a database, using the Classic Models sample database. You query the database for product information, log the names of product lines, and inspect sample output.

. Assuming you have connected a database to the flow for a Select operation, set up the query:
* In Database - Select, in General, enter SQL query text, omitting the semicolon. For example:
+
`SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3`
+
* Close the connector.
. In Design Center, click Run or Update.
. Select Running > Copy Link, paste the link in a browser, and go to the URL.
+
The HTTP listener hears the request and starts the app. 
+
. Open the database connector and select Live > Output.
+
The results of the query appear in JSON format:
+
----
[
  {
	"buyPrice": 48.81,
	"productScale": "1:10",
	"productLine": "Motocycles",
...
  }
]
----
. Log the product line names that are included in the query output: 
* For example, add a logger to the flow.
* In General, click image:function-key.png[f of x key]
* Delete the quotation marks and type the following message: `payload.` and pause.
+
DataSense displays the database column names and other valid payloads.
+
image:logger-data-sense.png[buyPrice Array(Number), MSRP, productCode, productDescirption, productLine, productName, productScale]
+
* Select a database column name. For example, `productLine`.
+
`payload.productLine`
+
. Click Update and select Running > Copy Link, paste the link in a browser, and go to the URL.
. View the log.
+
In the log, the product line names included in the query output appear:
+
`INFO  16:03:47  [Motorcycles, Classic Cars, Motorcycles]`
