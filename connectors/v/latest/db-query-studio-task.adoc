= To Query a Database (Studio)

In this procedure, you query the Classic Models sample database for product information, log the names of product lines, and inspect sample output. After setting up the query, the connector analyzes the query and compares it to the structure of the products table. DataSense then displays expected parameters as you type.

. Assuming you have connected a database to the flow for a Select operation, set up the query:
* In Query > SQL Query Text, enter SQL query text, omitting the semicolon. For example:
+
`SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3`
+
. Run the app. Trigger the app to activate DataSense. For example, enter the following URL in a browser, and press return: `+http://localhost:8081/trigger+`. This action facilitates writing expressions in the next step.
. Log the product line names that are included in the query output: 
* For example, add a logger to the flow.
* In Message, type *#[payload* followed by and period, and pause for hints.
+
DataSense shows the database column names and other valid payloads.

+
* Select a database column name. For example, select the productLine column, and enter the closing square bracket:
+
#[payload.productLine]
+
. Run the Mule application, and go to the `+http://localhost:8081/trigger+` again
+
The HTTP Listener hears the request, starts the app.
+
. View the log.
+
In the log, the product line names included in the query output appear:
+
`...[Motorcycles, Classic Cars, Motorcycles]`
