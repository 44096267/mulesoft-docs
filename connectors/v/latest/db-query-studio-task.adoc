= To Query a Database (Studio)

In this procedure, you query the Classic Models sample database for product information, log the names of product lines, and inspect sample output. After setting up the query in the database connector, the connector analyzes the query and compares it to the structure of the products table. DataSense then displays expected parameters as you type.

. Assuming you have connected a database to the flow for a Select operation, set up the query:
* In Query > SQL Query Text, enter SQL query text, omitting the semicolon. For example:
+
`SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3`
+
. Run the Mule application, and go to the URL. For example, enter the following URL in a browser or a client, such as Postman, and press return.
+
The HTTP listener hears the request, starts the app.
+
*-----------------------------------------------------------------*
*FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS TBD*
. In the database connector, and select Output.
+
The results of the query appear in JSON format:
+
----
[
  {
	"buyPrice": 48.81,
	"productScale": "1:10",
	"productLine": "Motocycles",
...
  }
]
----
. Log the product line names that are included in the query output: 
* For example, add a logger to the flow.
* Type *payload* followed by and period, and pause for hints.
+
DataSense shows the database column names and other valid payloads.
+
image:logger-data-sense.png[buyPrice Array(Number), MSRP, productCode, productDescription, productLine, productName, productScale]
+
* Select a database column name. For example, select the following column.
+
payload.productLine
+
. Run the Mule application, and go to the URL.
. View the log.
+
In the log, the product line names included in the query output appear:
+
`INFO  16:03:47  [Motorcycles, Classic Cars, Motorcycles]`
