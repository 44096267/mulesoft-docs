= To Publish Messages with JMS

When publishing a JMS message, the two most important things are:

* Message: The message must follow the JMS structure, so it must include a Body (the Mule message payload, by default), and it can also include user Properties (such as Reply To) and JMSX Properties.

* Destination: You can publish to the queue of an individual receiver or to a general topic. Besides defining the type of the destination, you need to name what queue or what topic to publish to.


To publish a message that contains the Mule message payload to a queue:


. Create a Mule application as a project.

. Add and configure an HTTP Listener as a trigger for your flow, and set a Path such as this one:
+
`/publish_message`
+
You can use the default configuration for the HTTP connection.

. After the HTTP Listener, add the JMS Publish operation to your flow.

. Create a JMS configuration for the connection, leaving all of the fields with their default values.

. Set the Destination to the name of the queue you want to publish to and leave the Destination Type as Queue.

. Leave the body of the message as `#[payload]`.

. Deploy, Sync, or Run the app.

. To test the app, send HTTP requests to http://url.for.your.app:8081/publish_message an app such as Postman, including an HTTP body.




== XML Examples


The example below shows the simplest possible implementation of a JMS Publish operation. It sends a message to a Queue named "myQueue", containing the Mule message payload as the JMS body. This example leaves several fields undefined and set as their default values.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish config-ref="config" destination="#[destination]"/>
----

The example below modifies the payload and publishes it to a Topic. It also adds a property that flags the message as a demo.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish config-ref="config" destination="#[destination]"
        destinationType="TOPIC">
  <jms:message>
    <jms:body>#["modified_" ++ payload]</jms:body>
    <jms:reply-to destination="${repliesQueue}"/>
    <jms:properties>#[{
      'MULE_JMS_DEMO': true
      }]</jms:properties>
    <jms:jmsx-properties jmsxAppID="DemoApp01"/>
  </jms:message>
</jms:publish>
