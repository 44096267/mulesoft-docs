The ServiceNow Connector facilitates connections between Mule and ServiceNow apps. The ServiceNow Connector 6.0 supports these operations: aggregate, deleteMultiple, deleteRecord, get, getKeys, getRecords, insert, insertMultiple, and update. You can use these operations with the custom ServiceNow tables, along with any operations available through the installed plugins.

Prerequisites:

* A ServiceNow account.
* Anypoint Studio, Design Center, or a standalone application developed in XML.

Note that if you are upgrading from a previous version of the connector through Anypoint Studio, a small popup appears in the bottom right corner with an "Updates Available" message.
