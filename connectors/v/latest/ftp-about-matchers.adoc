// For Anypoint Studio, Design Center: Email, FTP connectors

To narrow results of an operation such as List, you can create matchers to file or message properties (such as name patterns, dates, locations, and sizes). The results must match all specified properties. Partial matches are not returned.

FTP Example:

* Filename Pattern (as a regular expression): `a?*.{htm,html,pdf}`
* Path Pattern: `a?*.{htm,html,pdf}`
* Directory: `false`
* Max Size: `1024`
* Timestamp Since (as a `DateTime` instance or a `String` in ISO-8601 format): `2017-01-01T13:21:58+00:00`
