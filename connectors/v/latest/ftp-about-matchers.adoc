// For Anypoint Studio, Design Center: Email, FTP connectors

To narrow results of an operation such as List, you can create matchers to file or message properties (such as name patterns, dates, locations, and sizes). The results must match all specified values. Partial matches are not returned.

FTP Example:

* Filename Pattern (as a regular expression): `glob:**.{java, js}`, `regex:[0-9]*_test.csv`
+
Note that glob and regular expressions are supported. Glob is the default.
+
* Path Pattern: Same as the Filename Pattern but applies over the entire file path, not just the file name.
* Directory: `false`
* Max Size: `1024`
* Timestamp Since and Timestamp Until (as a `DateTime` instance or a `String` in ISO-8601 format): `2017-01-01T13:21:58+00:00`
+
Note that the timestamp settings include the specified date.
