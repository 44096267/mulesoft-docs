You can use the Delete operation to the File connector in a Mule app to delete a file from a local file system.

. In your flow, select the Delete operation from the File connector.
. Provide a Path to the file that you want to delete, for example,`path/to/deleteme.txt`.
. Perform any optional tasks you need:
  ** Set up or select a configuration for the connector.
  ** Provide a reconnection strategy.
  ** Map custom error messages to error codes.
