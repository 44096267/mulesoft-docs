= To Consume a REST Service (Studio)

You can design an app to consume a REST service by setting up one HTTP connector as a listener and another as a request. In this procedure, you first consume a REST API service using primarily default HTTP connector configurations for the listener and request. Next, you test the HTTP request. You edit the request configuration to make an HTTPS request. Finally, you test the HTTPS request.

. From the Mule Palette, drag an HTTP connector configured for the Listener operation, to a new flow.
. Set up the listener configuration: Click + and set the default host, port and base path. For example, host = 0.0.0.0, port = 8081, and no base path.
. In General, set Path to */trigger*.
. Accept the other default listener settings, and save the configuration.
. From Mule Palette, drag HTTP > Request, to the flow.
. Set up the request configuration:
+
* Set URL Or Path to `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`.
* Accept the other default settings and save.
+
. Deploy the app, run the app, open a browser, and go to `+localhost:8081/trigger+`.
+
The listener hears the request on port 8081, and starts the app. The requester gets a list of users, which appears in the browser.
. Change the request configuration to use HTTPS protocol.
* Set URL Or Path to `+https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`.
* Set the port to *443*.
* Accept the other default settings and save.
. Deploy the app, run the app, open a browser, and go to `+localhost:8081/trigger+`.
+
The listener hears the request on port 8081, and starts the app. The requester gets a list of users, which appears in the browser.
