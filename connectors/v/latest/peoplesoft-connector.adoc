The PeopleSoft Connector is a closed source connector that uses the Component Interface (CI) to communicate in real-time with the service. This is a component provided by Oracle’s People Tools.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and Global Elements.

You need PeopleSoft login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

To use this connector with Maven, view the pom.xml dependency information in
the Dependency Snippets in Anypoint Exchange.

=== What's New in this Connector

* Reorganized User Interface in the Connector configuration.
* The input and output of Operations is JSON.
* Fixed date conversion in Save operation.

== To Connect in Design Center
  
. In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver for this connector on your file system, and upload it. Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded.
. Click a trigger. You can create a global element by selecting this connector as they trigger.
If a global element is not needed, you can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.

//image::trigger.png[Trigger options]

To create an HTTP global element for the connector, set these fields:

// image::httpListener.png[Http Listener configuration]

. Protocol: Protocol selected for the http endpoint, it can be http or https (secure).
. Host: IP address where our Mule Application will listen requests.
. Port: Port address where our Mule Application will listen requests.
. Base Path: path where our Mule Application will listen requests.
. Select the plus sign to add a component.
+
// image::plusSign.png[add connector]
+
. Select the connector as a component.
. Configure these fields:
+
// image::PS_connector_config.png[Trigger options]
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Configuration Name |Enter a name for the configuration with which it can be referenced later.
|Application Server |Enter the URL of the server from where to access the services. It must comply with the form of HOST:PORT. For example: `my.host.com:9000`.
|Username |Enter a username to log into the PeopleSoft instance.
|Password |Enter the corresponding password.
|Domain Connection Password | Optional. If configured in the PeoplSoft instance, enter the domain connection password.
|Component Interface IDs |Select the Add button to set the names of your component interfaces and click OK.
|===

=== Add Libraries for this Connector

. Go to the connector's Global Configuration.
. Click Set Up under the message to setup drivers.
. Upload and select your libraries.
+
// image::libraryUpload.png[library upload]

== Connect in Anypoint Studio 7

You can use this connector in Anypoint Studio by first downloading it from Exchange
and configuring it as needed.

=== Install Connector in Studio

After calling the operation, you select a particular Component Interface name and an Operation in the Component Name field to to specify the method to execute.
. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for this connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install this connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner,
which you can click to install the update.

=== Configure in Studio

. Drag and drop the connector to the Studio Canvas.
. Create the connector configuration, configure the parameters and add the psjoa library.
. In the properties editor of the Invoke Operation, configure the remaining parameters:
+
[%header%autowidth]
|===

|Parameter|Value
|Display Name|Name of the operation to display in Studio
|Extension Configuration|The reference name to the global element you have created.
|Component Name|The component interface name .
|Operation|An operation to run over the selected CI.
|===

== Use Case: Studio

=== Retrieve a collection of employee records

image:ps-usecase-flow.png[Find Employees Flow]

In this example, all input parameters for the FIND operation are optional. If none of them defined (`http://localhost:8081/find?id=&name=&last_name=&name_ac=`), then PeopleSoft will retrieve the first 300 records available (the maximum limited by the server).


== Use Case: XML

== Component Interfaces (CI)

PeopleSoft's Component Interfaces are a “one-way”, real-time interface for your PeopleSoft database instance. A component in PeopleSoft is a logical grouping of PeopleSoft pages representing a complete business transaction, such as Employee Onboarding. Component Interfaces expose the underlying APIs used by PeopleSoft Components and, therefore, ensure that validations, defaults, and business logic are preserved from the original definition of those components.

The Component Interfaces allow you to query PeopleSoft for specific records, update data, and create new instances of the records.

=== Attributes and Architecture

A component interface has the following four main attributes:

image:ps-ci-architecture.jpeg[CI+archtecture]

* Component Interface Name: each component interface requires a unique name. The programs calling a component use the name of the component interface to access properties and methods. 
  Keys (Get keys, Create keys, and Find keys): keys are special properties containing values that retrieve an instance (get keys) or a list of instances (find keys) of the component interface. You can add, remove, or change keys in PeopleSoft Application Designer. Keys are created automatically when you create a component interface. +
* Get keys: Map to fields marked as search keys in the Components Search record.
* Create keys: Generated in CI when the Use tab on the Component Properties dialog allows the Add action.
* Find keys: Map to fields marked as both Alternate Search keys and Search Key in the Component Search Record.
  Properties and Collections (Fields and Records): properties provide access to both component data and component interface settings. A property can correspond to a field or a scroll (collection). A component interface collection is a special type of property that corresponds to a scroll and contains fields and subordinate scrolls as defined in its underlying component. There are two types of properties:   +
** Standard properties are assigned automatically when a component interface is created. 
** User-defined properties map to record fields on the PeopleSoft component and are displayed in the PeopleSoft Application Designer.
*  Methods: A method is a function that performs a specific task on a component interface at run time. There are two main types of methods: standard and user-defined.

Standard methods are those that are available for all component interfaces. The following are the standard methods that the connector supports:

[%header%autowidth]
|===
|Method |Description
|Create |Add a new instance of the Component Interface to the PeopleSoft database. This is similar to clicking Add and entering the relevant keys through the PeopleSoft Web UI.
|Cancel |Cancel an instance of the Component Interface. This is equivalent of the Cancel operation in the Web UI when working on a particular component.
|Find |Search for any instances of the component that match the provided Search Keys. This returns a list of possible matches.
|Get |Retrieve instances that match the specific keys you provide. This returns a single record or none at all.
|Save a|Save changes made to the component, new, or existing.

[WARNING]
The Save operation tries to update an existing record before creating a new one. For new records, the connector automatically populates the keys with default values provided by the PeopleSoft instance, thereby reducing the need for the user to provide the default key/values pairs.

|===

User-defined methods are created in PeopleSoft Application Designer to provide added functionality to the component interface.
