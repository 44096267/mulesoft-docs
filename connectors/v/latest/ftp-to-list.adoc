// For Anypoint Studio, Design Center: FTP connector

This example uses FTP connector operations to list files on an FTP server.

. Provide a Scheduler trigger for your flow with a Fixed Frequency of every 30 seconds (where Frequency = 30 and Time Unit = Seconds).
+
. Set up a List operation for the FTP connector:
.. Set up or select a configuration for the FTP connector.
+
You can set up an <<see_also,FTP or SFTP configuration>>.
+
.. Provide the Path (or Directory Path) to the files
+
Example: `/output`
+
. After the List operation, add For Each to your flow.
+
You can retain the default configuration.
+
. Within the For Each component, add a Logger.
+
* In Design Center, use the f(x) button to provide this Message: `attributes.fileName`
* In Anypoint Studio, add the following Message to your Logger: `#[attributes.fileName]`
. Deploy, Run, or Sync your application.
. Once your application is deployed (or running), check the Logs or Console.
+
You can find the file names in the log, for example:
