= To Connect a Database (Design Center)

In this procedure, you connect the popular MySQL Classic Models database to a Mule app. The procedure assumes you imported the database into a MySQL server. You can download the Classic Models database from the internet:

`+http://www.mysqltutorial.org/download/2+`

You also need a JDBC driver compatible with your database server. 

. Create a new Mule Application project. In New Flow, click Trigger, and select the HTTP Listener.
. In General, set Path to the path of the URL you plan to use to start the app from the browser. For example, set Path to */trigger*.
. Accept or change the existing CloudHub HTTP configuration. For example, accept the default CloudHub HTTP configuration:
+
* Protocol: HTTP
* Host: *0.0.0.0*
* Port: 8081
+
. Click + to add another connector operation to the flow, and select Database. Choose an operation, for example, Select.
. At the top of Database - Select, click Set Up, and set the following options:
+
* Configuration Name: Optionally, change the name from the default Database to Classic Models Database.
* In Connection, select the MySQL Connection type.
+
Other fields appear.
+
. Continue setting options:
+
* In Host, enter the URL of the MySQL server host on the Internet.
* In Port, enter *3306*.
* User: Enter your MySQL server user name.
* Password: Enter your MySQL server password.
* Database: Enter *classicmodels*.
* In the banner at the top of the page, click Set Up to set up a driver.
* On Database Drivers, choose File, select, and upload a database driver from your file system. Alternatively, if you or someone in your organization already uploaded a driver for the database, put your cursor in the File text box and pause. When options appear, select a driver, and click Done.
. After completing the upload, test, and if successful, save the configuration.
+
You are ready to set up the SQL Query Text to complete the database connector configuration.
