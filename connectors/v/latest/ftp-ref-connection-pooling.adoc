Connection Pooling allows you to use a set of Mule connection components that share a single physical connection to a server. Pooling can speed operations, such as file transfers between an FTP client and server.

Once a physical connection to the server is established by an operation that is configured to use the pool, other similarly configured operations can make use of that connection instead of opening a new physical connection to the server.

* Max Active: Maximum number of connection components available at one time. When the value is a negative number, any number of components can be active at one time. When the Max Active value is exceeded, the pool is exhausted.
* Max Idle: Maximum number of idle connection components allowed in the connection pool at one time.
* Min Eviction Millis: Minimum number of milliseconds that a connection component can remain idle before it is marked for eviction from the pool. A negative value prevents the eviction of idle connections from the pool.
* Eviction Check Interval Millis: The number of milliseconds before connection components that are marked for eviction are removed from the pool. A negative value prevents the eviction of connection components.
* Exhausted Action: Specifies the behavior of the pool when there are no available connection components.
  ** When Exhausted Grow: Creates a new connection component. The Max Active setting has no effect in this case.
  ** When Exhausted Wait: Blocks (or waits) until a new or idle component is available.
  ** When Exhausted Fail: Throws an exception when the pool is exhausted.
* Initialisation Policy: Determines how components in a pool should be initialized.
  ** Initialise None: Does not load any components into the pool on startup.
  ** Initialise One: Loads one initial component into the pool on startup.
  ** Initialise All: Loads all components into the pool on startup.
* Disabled: Disables connection pooling. This means that a new physical connection to the server is needed for each separate operation in the flow that uses the connector configuration.
