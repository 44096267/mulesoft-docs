= Object Store Connector
:keywords: object store, object, store, connnector

The Object Store connector is an operation-based connector allowing you to work with object stores.

An object store is a facility for storing objects in or across Mule applications. Mule uses object stores to persist data for eventual retrieval. Internally, Mule uses object stores in various filters, routers, and other message processors that need to store state between messages.

. If an operation has an Advanced tab, this tab contains the Target Variable field where you can specify the name 
of a variable into which the output of the operation is placed. For example, if the target variable is named OperationOutput, you can view the output using OperationOutput.payload or OperationOutput.attributes.
