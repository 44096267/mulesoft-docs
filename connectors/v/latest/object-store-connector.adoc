An object store lets you temporarily store data in the form or key/value pairs.

The object store lets you store any serializable data such as JSON, XML, that you can define. Mule uses object stores to persist data for eventual retrieval. Internally, 
Mule uses object stores in various filters, routers, and other message processors that need 
to store state between messages.

Data passes to the 
object store, which you define how to store the data. In its simplest form for testing purposes, 
you could hardcode the key and value so that any data received stores in one key name with one value. This isn't practical for a real program, so you can use a key value like `payload.key` so that you can send a key value in the data. Similarly, you can set the value part of the key/value to `payload.value`. 


== To Configure

. In Anypoint Platform, click Design Center.
. Create a new project as a Mule Application.
. Add an HTTP Listener trigger. See link:/connectors/http-trigger-app-from-browser[To Start an App from a Browser] for configuration information.
. Click the plus sign to create an ObjectStore component.
. Choose an operation and add a value for each field. You can enter a simplified statement for a field or value such as payload.key or payload.value. You can also click the Map button to use DataWeave Transform to map out a more complex structure of values.

|Operation |Fields |Description
|Clear |none |Clears all keys and their values from the object store.
|Contains |Key |Checks whether the object store contains the Key value.
|Remove |Key |Removes the Key you specify and its value from the object store.

|Retrieves the Key you specify and its value from the object store. You can also specify a Default Value to retrieve.

Fail on Null Value

|Stores an object in the object store. This can also indicate if a key can be overwritten or not.

Fields:

* Key: (Required) Specify the name of a key such as `payload.key`.
* Value: (Required) Specify the value as a text value, or a statement that you can fill in from a program calling the  as `payload.value`, or click Map if you have a set of values in JSON. Map opens a user interface using the DataWeave transform that lets you specify the JSON map structure that you want to store in the object store.
* Fail if Present: Fail if the key already exists.
* Fail on Null Value: Fail if the key has a null value

. If an operation has an Advanced tab, this tab contains the Target Variable field where you can specify the name 
of a variable into which the output of the operation is placed. For example, if the target variable is named OperationOutput, you can view the output using OperationOutput.payload or OperationOutput.attributes.
