This example describes the general configuration steps for using a ServiceNow operation in a Mule app.

. Create a Mule application as a Design Center or Studio 7 Mule project.
+
. Add and configure a trigger, such as the HTTP Listener or Scheduler, for your flow.
+
You can accept the default settings for the HTTP Listener or Scheduler and provide any required values.
+
. If you need to check your ServiceNow credentials, you can authenticate against the ServiceNow server (endpoint) by defining an HTTP Requester with BASIC Auth credentials.
. Add the ServiceNow-Invoke operation.
. From the Invoke operation, configure and save a connection to the ServiceNow server.
