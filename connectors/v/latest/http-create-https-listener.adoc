= To Create an HTTPS Listener
:keywords: anypoint, connectors, transports

The workflow describes how to create an HTTPS Listener secured by TLS 1.2. The listener responds to an HTTPS URL that you enter in a browser to start an app. 

. Create a new project, and in Trigger, select HTTP.

. Edit the listener configuration.
+
* In Configuration Name, accept the default name. 
* In Protocol, select HTTPS.
* Set the host = *0.0.0.0*.
* Set the port = *8082*.
* Accept the default no base path.
. In General, set Path to the path of the HTTP URL. For example, enter */tls-listener*.
. Configure TLS, and then accept the other default listener settings and close the connector.
. Add logic to the flow to create an app. For example, add another HTTP connector and configure an HTTP Request to consume a REST service.
. Run the app, open a browser, and enter the path you configured. For example, 
+
`+http://localhost:8081/tls-trigger+`
