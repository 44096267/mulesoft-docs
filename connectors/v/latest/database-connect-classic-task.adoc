= To Connect the Classic Models Database

In this procedure you connect a popular database to a Mule app and construct a query to select a row. The WHERE clause of the query selects a row from this database that has a primary key value higher than the object store variable lastOrder. This variable equals the primary key value of the last row inserted into another database.

== Prerequisites

This procedure assumes you already imported the Classic Models database into a MySQL server. You can download this database from the internet:
