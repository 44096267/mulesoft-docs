= Database Connector Streaming Reference

Large database tables, typical in integration applications, have tens of thousands of records or more. Fetching all the data at once is problematic: performance degradation and memory problems occur. Use the following solutions:

* Streaming incorporated into Mule 4.0 and later
+
Streaming is transparent, always enabled, and repeatable. Streams can be processed in parallel.
+ 
* Limiting the Resultset


The following example shows how to set the fetchSize to limit the resultset.
 
<db:select fetchSize="200" config-ref="dbConfig"> 
  <db:sql>select * from some_table</db:sql>
</db:select>
 

The following example shows a query over a table with many rows, but yielding a resultset limited to the first 1000. 
 
<db:select maxRows="1000" config-ref="dbConfig">
   <db:sql>select * from some_table</db:sql>
</db:select>
