= To Start an App from a Browser

In this procedure, you configure an HTTP connector as a listener. You set an HTTP URL consisting of a host name, a port, and a path. When the listener receives the request from your a browser, it initiates the app.

. Create a new project and a new flow.  Select the HTTP connector..
. In a Connector configuration, accept an existing configuration or add one as follows:
+
* Protocol: Select HTTP.
* Host: *0.0.0.0*
* Port: 8081
+
. In General, set Path to the path of the HTTP URL. For example, set Path to */trigger*.
. In Allowed Methods, type GET.
. Accept the other default listener settings and close the connector.
. Add logic to your flow. For example, add logic to consume a REST service.
. Run the app, open a browser, and enter the path you configured: `+http://localhost:8081/trigger+`.
