= To Trigger an App from a Browser

In this procedure, you configure an HTTP connector as a listener. You set an HTTP URL consisting of a host name, a port, and a path. When the listener hears you enter that HTTP URL in a browser, it initiates the app.

. In Design Center, create a new project and select a trigger. For example, select HTTP.
. Accept or change the listener configuration. For example, accept the default CloudHub HTTP configuration, which is host name = 0.0.0.0 and port = 8081.
+
. In General, set Path to the path of the HTTP URL. For example, set Path to `/`.
. In Allowed Methods, type GET.
. Accept the other default listener settings and close the connector.
