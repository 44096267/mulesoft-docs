= About Connecting to a Generic Database

A generic database configuration connects your Mule app to any RDBMS. In the configuration, you need to set up the driver compatible with the database you want to connect to your app. 

* In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver on your file system, and then upload it. 
+
Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded.

+
* In Studio, you configure the URL of the database and the fully qualified class name of the JDBC driver you want to use. 
+
For example, you are using the default database password and user name and you want to connect to a database named stock. Configure the database URL as follows:
+
`+jdbc:postgresql://myhost:5432/stock?password=postgres&user=postgres+`
+
You also need to configure the driver class name. For Postgres, for example, this name is `org.postgresql.Driver`. 

The Design Center and Studio database configurations look something like this:
