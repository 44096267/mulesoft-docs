= Query Timeout Reference
 
Sometimes queries take a long time to execute. The following factors often cause delays in query execution:

* An inefficient query, such as one having improper indexing that iterates over many rows
* A busy RDBMS or network
* A lock contention

Generally, it's recommended to set a timeout on the query as follows:
 
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:select queryTimeout="0" queryTimeoutUnit="SECONDS" config-ref="dbConfig">
   <db:sql>select * from some_table</db:sql>
</db:select>
----
