= Query Timeout Reference
 
The database connector is one of the MuleSoft connectors that provides settings for changing timeouts for actions such as reading, writing, making connections, or waiting for responses from a server. Sometimes database queries take a long time to execute. The following factors often cause delays in query execution:

* An inefficient query, such as one having improper indexing that iterates over many rows
* A busy RDBMS or network
* A lock contention

Generally, it's recommended to set a timeout on the query. To manage timeouts, configure queryTimeout and queryTimeoutUnit. The following example shows how to set a timeout for the Select operation, but all operations support setting a timeout:
 
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:select queryTimeout="0" queryTimeoutUnit="SECONDS" config-ref="dbConfig">
   <db:sql>select * from some_table</db:sql>
</db:select>
----
