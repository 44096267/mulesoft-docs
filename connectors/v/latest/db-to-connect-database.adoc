= To Connect a Database

You can add a database connector to a flow that has trigger. Prior to adding the trigger, the option to add a database connector is unavailable.

This procedure uses the popular MySQL Classic Models database for example purposes. You can download this database from the internet:

`+http://www.mysqltutorial.org/download/2+`

. Add a trigger, such as an HTTP listener, to initiate an app from a browser. For example, listen on port 8081 of all interfaces 0.0.0.0.
. Download a JDBC driver, compatible with the database you want to set up, to your hard drive. For example, download a MySQL database driver.
. In Design Center, click + to add a component to a flow.
. Choose the Database component, and then choose an operation, such as Select.
