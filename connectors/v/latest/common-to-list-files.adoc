// For Anypoint Studio, Design Center: FTP connector

This procedure uses the connector's List operation to list all files in a directory that match file properties. The operation can recurse through subdirectories.

Precondition: You must configure a trigger for your flow before using the Read operation, for example, with the HTTP or Polling connector.

. After adding the connector to your flow, select the List operation.
. Set up or select a Configuration for the connector.
. Provide a Directory Path to the files that you want to list.
. Select Recursive if you want to include the contents of subdirectories.
. Opt to provide a matcher to the files that you want to list.
