= To List Files with a File Connector
:keywords: file, ftp, connector, operation

:toc-title:

You can use the List operation to the File connector in a Mule app to list all files in a directory that match file properties. The operation can recurse through subdirectories.

. In your flow, select the List operation from the File connector.
. Provide a Directory Path to the directory that contains the files you want to list.
. Perform any optional tasks you need:
  ** Set up or select a configuration for the connector.
  ** Check Recursive if you also want to list the files within subdirectories.
  ** Provide File Matching Rules if you want to narrow the list of files to return.
  ** Set a Target Variable if you need to store output of the operation in a variable for later use in the flow.
  ** Set a Reconnection Strategy.

== XML Example

This example uses a matcher list all files with the extension `*.json` that are found in the `in/` directory path and all of its subdirectories. It also specifies a reconnection strategy.

----
<file:list config-ref="File_Config_In" directoryPath="in/" doc:name="List" recursive="true">
  <reconnect frequency="5000" count="4"/>
  <file:matcher filenamePattern="*.json"/>
</file:list>
