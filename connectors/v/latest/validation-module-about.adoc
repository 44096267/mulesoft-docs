= About the Validation Module

The Validation module enables you to verify that the contents of a message in a Mule flow matches a specific criteria. In contrast to Filters, the Validation module provides more explicit messages about what causes an exception to occur in a Mule flow. Based on the specific data you are validating, you can further customize the exception message that is displayed in the logs.

If the message being validated does not meet the defined criteria, the validation fails and returns a ValidationException. By default, this message includes a meaningful message. You can customize this message and change the type of exception that is thrown. In this case, the exception type must have a constructor that overrides Exception(String).

To throw an exception that does not contain Exception(String) or that is more complicated, create a custom validation component.

== Supported Validation Operations

The following types of validations are supported by this module:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

| Is Email | Checks that a given email is valid.

| Is Empty | Verifies that a payload is empty.

| Is Not Empty | Verifies that a payload is not empty.

| Is True | Verifies that an expression is true.

| Is False | Verifies that an expression is false.

| Is IP | Checks that a given ip address is valid. It supports both IPV4 and IPV6. In the case of IPV6, both full and collapsed addresses are supported, but addresses containing ports are not.

| Is Not Null | Fails if the value is null or an instance of NullPayload

| Is Null | Fails if the value is not null and not an instance of NullPayload

| Is Number | Verifies that a String can be parsed as a number of a certain type.

| Is Time | Verifies that an expression is a valid date. The date format used depends on the locale being used.

| Is URL | Validates that a given String can be interpreted as a URL. This is done by invoking the URL(String) constructor in the 'java.net.URL' class. If this constructor throws exception, then the validation fails. Any String that this constructor accepts is considered valid.

| Matches Regex | Validates that a given expression matches a Java regular expression.

| Validate Size | Validates that the input’s size is between given min and max boundaries. It’s valid for inputs of type String, Collection, Map and Array. In the case of a String, the size refers to the length in characters.
