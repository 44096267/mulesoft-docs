= To Query a Database

. Add a connector to a new project to trigger an app from a browser. 
. Connect a database to perform the Select operation.
. Set up the query in the database connector configuration:
* In SQL Query Text, enter a SQL query, omitting the semicolon. For example, `SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 3`. 
* Close the connector.
. Capture the results of the query and format the results for readability. 
* For example, add a logger to the flow.
* In General, type the following message: `payload.` and pause.
+
DataSense displays the database column names and other valid payloads.
+
* Select a database column name. For example, `columnA`.
* Set up the logger to display the name of one of the columns. For example, type `[0]` after the column name to display the first column name and its value:
+
`payload.columnA[0]`
+
. On Logger-Config, click Data Types, and define format of the output:
* In Input -  Payload, select a Custom Type, and click New.
* In New Type, enter a name. For example, enter `ColumnOutput`.
* Accept the default option From Example.
* Enter a JSON example. For example, enter `{"columnA":"valueA"}`.
* Close Logger - Config.
. In Designer, click Run or Update.
. Select Running > Copy Link and go to the URL.
+
. View the log.
+
The value of the first column appears in the log.
