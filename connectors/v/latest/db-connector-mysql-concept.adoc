= About Connecting to a MySQL Database

You need to configure a connection to a MySQL database. In the configuration, you need to set up the MySQL JDBC driver. In Design Center, for example, assuming you have the driver on a file system, you click Set Up > Upload to set up the driver in Exchange. In Studio, you configure the path to the driver.

To configure the database, you provide the following information:

* Type: Select MySQL.
* Host: The domain name of the host database. In Design Center the host needs to be a location on the internet.
* Port: The default is 3306.
* User: The name of the MySQL user you set up.
* Password: The MySQL password you set up.
* Database: The name of the database you plan to query.

In Design Center, the database configuration looks something like this:
