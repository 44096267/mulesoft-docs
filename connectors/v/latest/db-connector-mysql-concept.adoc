= About Connecting to a MySQL Database

To configure a connection to a MySQL database, you select the MySQL connection type and provide access to an MySQL JDBC driver and database. 

* In Design Center, click Set Up > Upload, browse for and select the driver on your file system, and then upload it. 
+
Alternatively, search for and select a driver that is already uploaded. 
+
* In Studio, add a maven dependency on the MySQL JDBC driver. 

For example, in Database Config, click Add Dependency, search the Maven repository for a MySQL driver that matches your database, and select it. When you select a MySQL driver, the connector captures the Maven information for it. For example:

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.6</version>
</dependency>
----

To configure the database, you provide the following additional information:

* Type: Select MySQL.
* Host: The domain name of the host database. In Design Center the host needs to be a location on the internet. In Studio, the host is the computer, such as localhost, that runs MySQL. 
* Port: The default is 3306.
* User: The name of the MySQL user you set up.
* Password: The MySQL password you set up.
* Database: The name of an existing database in MySQL.

The Design Center and Studio database configuration looks something like this:
