= About Connecting to a MySQL Database

You need to configure a connection to a MySQL database. In the configuration, you need to set up the MySQL JDBC driver. 

* In Design Center, if you have the driver on a file system, click Set Up > Upload to set up the driver in Exchange. 
* In Studio, configure a maven dependency on the driver. For example, during connector configuration enter maven information for a MySQL driver that matches your database. For example:

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.6</version>
</dependency>
----

To configure the database, you provide the following additional information:

* Type: Select MySQL.
* Host: The domain name of the host database. In Design Center the host needs to be a location on the internet. In Studio, the host is the name of the computer or service that runs MySQL.
* Port: The default is 3306.
* User: The name of the MySQL user you set up.
* Password: The MySQL password you set up.
* Database: The name of the database you plan to query.

The database configuration UI looks something like this:
