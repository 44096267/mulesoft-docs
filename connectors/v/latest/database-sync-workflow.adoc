= Workflow: Synchronize a Database

This workflow uses a scheduler to execute the flow periodically. The logic inserts data that meets certain conditions from the Classic Models database to another database, keeping the databases synchronized with respect to the conditional data. The completed flow looks like this:

== Prerequisites

The procedure assumes you already imported the Classic Models database into a MySQL server. You can download this database from the internet:

`+http://www.mysqltutorial.org/download/2+`

You also need a JDBC driver compatible with the database. During configuration of the database connector, you upload, or refer to a previously uploaded, JDBC driver compatible with your database server.
