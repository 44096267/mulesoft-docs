= Workflow: Synchronize a Database

This workflow uses a scheduler to scan the Classic Models database periodically and transfer data that meets certain conditions to another database. The completed flow looks like this:

== Prerequisites

The procedure assumes you already imported the database into a MySQL server. You can download the Classic Models database from the internet:

`+http://www.mysqltutorial.org/download/2+`

You also need a JDBC driver compatible with the database. During configuration of the database connector, you upload or refer to a previously uploaded JDBC driver compatible with your database server.
