|===
|Configuration |Description
|Login Authentication |Makes use of the SuiteTalk's login API call on the first request sent by the connector to establish a session with NetSuite.
|Request Level Authentication |Using this strategy, you can send user credentials in the SOAP header of each request instead of authenticating to NetSuite by invoking login.
|Single Sign-On Login Authentication |This is a token based authentication system that avoids the use of environment username and password. Here you supply a privateKey together with other information. The connector is then responsible for generating an authentication token and establishing a session with NetSuite via the `ssoLogin` API call on the first request.
|Request Level Token Based Authentication |Similar to Single Sign-On Login Authentication, this is a token based authentication system. However, instead of using a privateKey generated via openssl, this uses a consumer and token key/secret pairs which are established within the NetSuite environment.

== To Set Up SSO Login Authentication 

To use the SSO Login Authentication, enable this feature in your sandbox environment using NetSuite Support. NetSuite provides an SSO Kit and information on how to proceed with setting up private and public keys for use in generating authentication tokens. They also provide you with a Partner ID. After this setup is established, a mapping has to be created between the standard NetSuite credentials, the partner ID, company ID, and user ID. A developer or administrator should perform this mapping. It is not handled by the connector and it is only done once for each user ID that is allowed to authenticate using SSO within your company.

For this mapping, start by generating a token using the SSO Kit provided by NetSuite. To establish the mapping, invoke the SuiteTalks Web Service API call `mapSso` using an external Java application or any other method of your choice. A sample SOAP request of the `mapSso` API call looks as follows:

== To Set Up Request Level Token Based Authentication

To use this authentication mechanism, set up an Integration Record within NetSuite and enable Token Based Authentication. This generates a consumer key and secret for you.

Set up an access token from within your NetSuite environment that combines the Integration Record with a user. This assumes that your NetSuite account has the required permissions enabled to generate the tokens.

Refer to the NetSuite Help Center or SuiteAnswers for detailed information on how to navigate NetSuite and set this up.

== To Set Up the NetSuite Namespace and Schema

In Anypoint Studio, when you drag the NetSuite connector from the palette to the Anypoint Studio canvas, Studio populates the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location for you. However, if you are using the XML editor or creating a standalone use the connector, you need to add the namespace and schema location to your application.

* Namespace: `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/netsuite`
* Schema Location: `http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/netsuite/current/mule-netsuite.xsd`

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, define the namespace and schema location in the header of your Configuration XML, inside the `<mule>` tag.

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:netsuite="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/netsuite"

== To Use the Connector in a Mavenized Mule App

If you are coding a Mavenized Mule application, this XML snippet must be included in your `pom.xml` file.

== To Make RESTlet Calls

NetSuite RESTlets allow you to develop custom RESTful web services for your NetSuite account using JavaScript and SuiteScript.
The example calls a script deployed as a RESTlet via the GET method. Here, we are attempting to get the CUSTOMER record with id = 700 using the RESTlet with script = 546 and deploy = 1.

    <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger"/>
</flow>
----

== To Use DataWeave

The NetSuite connector’s DataSense capability coupled with that of DataWeave via the Transform Message component makes integrating with your NetSuite environment straightforward. For the following two examples, we use a JSON input string and extract the necessary data from it to form our NetSuite request.

This example code adds a Journal Entry to NetSuite from the following JSON input:

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
   "tranId":"SampleJournal123",
   "subsidiary":{
      "internalId":"1"
   },
   "customFieldList":{
      "customField":[
         {
            "StringCustomFieldRef__custbodytestbodyfield":"Sample Transaction Body Custom Field"
         }
      ]
   },
   "lineList":{
      "line":[
         {
            "account":{
               "internalId":"1"
            },
            "debit":100.0,
            "customFieldList":{
               "customField":[
                  {
                     "SelectCustomFieldRef__custcol_far_trn_relatedasset":{
                         "internalId":"1"
                     }
                  },
                  {
                     "StringCustomFieldRef__custcoltestcolumnfield": "Sample Transaction Column Custom Field 1"
                  }
               ]
            }
         },
         {
            "account":{
               "internalId":"1"
            },
            "credit":100.0,
            "customFieldList":{
               "customField":[
                  {
                     "SelectCustomFieldRef__custcol_far_trn_relatedasset":{
                         "internalId":"2"
                     }
                  },
                  {
                     "StringCustomFieldRef__custcoltestcolumnfield": "Sample Transaction Column Custom Field 2"
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
----


The "add operation for the connector expects a Map as input. Here is the DataWeave script to paste into the Transform Message DataWeave editor:

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
	customFieldList: payload.customFieldList,
	lineList: payload.lineList,
	subsidiary: payload.subsidiary,
	tranId: payload.tranId
}
----

In this example, we use the same scenario for basic search as described in the previous section. However, instead of constructing the criteria in a java component, we transform a JSON string:


[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
   "companyName": {
      "operator": "STARTS_WITH",
      "searchValue": "A"
   },
   "isPerson": false,
   "priority": {
      "operator": "EQUAL_TO",
      "searchValue": 50
   }
}
----

Here is the DataWeave script to paste into the Transform Message DataWeave editor:

[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
	customFieldList: {
		customField: [{
			scriptId: "custentity_cust_priority",
			operator: payload.priority.operator,
			searchValue: payload.priority.searchValue
		} as :object {
			class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchLongCustomField"
		}]
	} as :object {
		class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchCustomFieldList"
	},
	companyName: {
		operator: payload.companyName.operator,
		searchValue: payload.companyName.searchValue
	} as :object {
		class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchStringField"
	},
	isPerson: {
		searchValue: payload.isPerson
	} as :object {
		class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.core.SearchBooleanField"
	}
} as :object {
	class : "com.netsuite.webservices.platform.common.CustomerSearchBasic"
}
----

== To Use Search Operations

In NetSuite, the search operation can be used to execute a Basic Search, Joined Search, or an Advanced Search. To this end, you need to instantiate one of these three search types for the record type you want to query:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Search Operation |Description
|`<Record>SearchBasic`|Used to execute a search on a record type based on search filter fields that are specific to that type.
|`<Record>Search` +
|Used to execute a search on a record type based on search filter fields specific to that type and others that are associated with a related record type.
|`<Record>SearchAdvanced` +
|Used to execute a search on a record type in which you specify search filter fields and/or search return columns or joined search columns. Using advanced search, you can also return an existing saved search.
|===

This also applies for the asynchronous equivalent of search, the `asyncSearch` operation.

=== Search Pagination Support

Support for pagination was added to `search` for NetSuite connector version 7.0.0.

The connector's search capability is now unified under one operation. Other search-related processors have been removed. Thus, `search` always retrieves the whole set of results. Therefore users do not need to work with `searchNext` or `searchMore` in order to get the rest of the records from subsequent pages. The return type is also different; the processor will output a List of Maps representing each and every record obtained by your search criteria.

An important aspect to note is that pagination could not be applied to the asynchronous equivalent of `search` (`asyncSearch`). This is due to the fact that the actual pagination would have to be applied to the `getAsyncResult` operation. This would mean that only the first page would end up being retrieved asynchronously. Furthermore, `getAsyncResult` is common to all async operations. Hence we cannot even apply pagination here since the return type of this operation depends on what async operation was invoked.

Regarding the new search configuration, the connector is the same apart from a new attribute called `fetchSize`:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<netsuite:paged-search config-ref="NetSuite__Login_Authentication"
    searchRecord="CUSTOMER_BASIC"
    fetchSize="5"
    doc:name="Customer Basic Search"/>
----

=== ItemSearchAdvanced and ReturnSearchColumns

When using `search` the connector  outputs a list of maps representing the Record objects returned by your `search` operation. If using an advanced search and the `returnSearchColumns` flag is set to true, NetSuite returns a `SearchRowList` containing the search results. The connector would then be responsible for mapping `SearchRows` into the corresponding `Record` type object in order to facilitate usability.

However, in the case of `ItemSearchAdvanced` the connector does not do this mapping and provides the user with the SearchRows. This is the case due to the fact that ITEMs in NetSuite can be of various types and we cannot assume the item type from an `ItemSearchRow`. This issue can also occur with any other record type that behaves similar to `ITEM`, but we are not aware of others.

== To Use Custom Field DataSense

In NetSuite, you can add different types of custom fields and have these customizations apply to different record types. With DataSense enabled, the NetSuite connector retrieves and shows these fields. Note however that we do not fully support all the customization types that NetSuite users are able to define.
The following lists outline what fields we do and do not handle, and where they appear in relation to the record type's attributes. For the most part you can see that customizations are usually present within a list field called _customFieldList_, but in some cases these might reside elsewhere.
