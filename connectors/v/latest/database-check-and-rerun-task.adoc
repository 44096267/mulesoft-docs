= To Check Database Synchronization, Rerun, and Pause

This procedure describes how to check that the synchronization works, to rerun the app, and to pause the app. The scheduler continues to run if you don't pause.

. Click Deploy if the app isn't deployed, or restart if you can't deploy the app. 
+
. Wait 15 seconds, and check that the logs show no problems.
. Query the neworders database.
+
The orders table in the database contains five rows, as shown in this MySQL Workbench screenshot:

+
. Insert some rows into the orders table of the Classic Models database that meet the conditions you set for synchronization by bulk insertion. For example, insert the following rows using the mysql command line, or using a tool such as MySQL Workbench:
----
INSERT  INTO `orders`(`orderNumber`,`orderDate`,`requiredDate`,`shippedDate`,`status`,`comments`,`customerNumber`) VALUES 
(11111,'2005-05-30','2005-06-05',NULL,'In Process',NULL,353),

(11112,'2005-05-31','2005-06-08',NULL,'In Process',NULL,353),

(11113,'2005-05-31','2005-06-07',NULL,'In Process',NULL,353);
----
. After 15 seconds, check that the new rows appear in the orders table of the neworders database.
. Select Pause to pause the running app.
