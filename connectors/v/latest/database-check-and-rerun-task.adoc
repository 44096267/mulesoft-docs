= To Check Database Synchronization

This procedure covers the following things:

* Checking that the synchronization works
* Reruning the app
* Pausing the app 

The scheduler continues to run if you don't pause.

. Click Deploy if the app isn't deployed, or choose Restart Workspace if you can't deploy the app.

+
. Wait 15 seconds, and then check that no errors appear in the logs and components display the green status indicator. If there are errors, check the configuration of the components having a red status indicator, and restart the workspace.
. Query the New Orders database using the mysql command line or a tool, such as MySQL Workbench.
+
The orders table in the New Orders database contains five rows, as shown in this MySQL Workbench screenshot:

+
. Insert some rows that meet the conditions for synchronization into the orders table of the Classic Models database. For example, insert the following rows using the mysql command line or a tool, such as MySQL Workbench:
+
----
INSERT  INTO `orders`(`orderNumber`,`orderDate`,`requiredDate`,`shippedDate`,`status`,`comments`,`customerNumber`) VALUES 
(11111,'2005-05-30','2005-06-05',NULL,'In Process',NULL,353),

(11112,'2005-05-31','2005-06-08',NULL,'In Process',NULL,353),

(11113,'2005-05-31','2005-06-07',NULL,'In Process',NULL,353);
----
+
. After 15 seconds, check that the new rows appear in the orders table of the neworders database.
. Select Pause to pause the running app.
