The database connector establishes communication between your app and a relational database. The connector facilitates setting up the following databases for use in a Mule app:

* Derby
* MySQL
* Oracle

The connector also supports the set up of these, and other JDBC databases, using a generic JDBC configuration. You can also reference a data source specified by a Spring bean.

The database connector supports the following operations:

* Creating and running stored procedures
* Creating tables using the EXECUTE DDL operation
* Issuing select, insert, update, and delete queries
* Executing inline and file-based SQL scripts
* Performing bulk operations: delete, insert, update
* Operations, such as running DDL statements against the database, using a script
