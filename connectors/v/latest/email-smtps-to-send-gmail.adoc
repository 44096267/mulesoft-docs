// Anypoint Studio, Design Center: *Email* connector

[[short_description]]
This example provides guidance on sending an email from a Gmail account over SMTP.

[[set_up_imap]]
. Add an HTTP trigger to your flow with a Path like this:
+
`/send`
+
. Add the Email - Send operation to your flow.
. From the Send operation, click to Set Up the Email SMTP Configuration.
+
Note that in Anypoint Studio, you open a similar configuration window by selecting the `+` under Basic Settings in the General tab of the operation.
+
* Provide a Name for the configuration, for example: `My Email SMTPS configuration`.
* Select the `SMTPS Connection` type.
* Provide the Gmail host: `smtp.gmail.com`
* Provide a Port: `587`
* Provide a User, for example: `myuser@gmail.com`
* Provide a Password, for example: `mygmailpassword`
* For the TLS Configuration, set Trust Store to `Insecure`.
+
You can keep any default configurations that remain.
+
. Click Test (or Test Connection).
+
You should receive a response like this: `Test successful`
+
If the connection fails, check and Save your settings again.
+
. Save the configuration.
. In the General tab for the operation, provide this information:
+
* From Address, for example: `myuser@gmail.com`
* To Address, for example: `somebody@somecompany.com`
* Subject: `"My Subject"`
* Content: `"My Content"`
* Content Type: `text/plain`
+
. Add a Logger to the end of your flow with a Message such as `"My Logger Message"`.
. Deploy, Sync, or Run the app.
. Once the app is deployed (or running), copy the link to your app in a browser, and append the Listener path (`/send`), for example:
+
`myproject-abcd.some.cloudhub.io/send`
+
Note that you can get the link to the app from the menu (3 small, vertical dots) beside the Deploy button in Design Center.

+
. [Optional] Check your email inbox for the new message.
. Check your logs for any errors.
+
If there are no errors, you should see INFO from your Logger Message, for example:
+
----
INFO 14:10:40 "My Logger Message"
----
