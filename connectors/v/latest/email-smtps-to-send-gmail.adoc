[[set_up_imap]]
. Add an HTTP trigger to your flow with a Path like this:
+
`/send`
+
. Add the Email - Send operation to your flow.
. From the Send operation, click to Set Up the Email SMTP Configuration.
+
Note that in Anypoint Studio, you open a similar configuration window by selecting the `+` under Basic Settings in the General tab of the operation.
+
* Provide a Name for the configuration, for example, `My Email SMTP configuration`.
* Select the `SMTPS Connection` type.
* Provide the Gmail host: `smtp.gmail.com`
* Provide a Port: `587`
* Provide a User, for example: `myuser@gmail.com`
* Provide a Password, for example: `mygmailpassword`
* Set the Trust Store Configuration to `Insecure`.
+
You can keep any default configurations that remain.
+
. Click Test (or Test Connection).
+
You should receive a response like this: `Test successful`
+
If the connection fails, check and Save your settings again.
+
. Save the configuration.
. In the General tab for the operation, provide this information:
+
* From Address: `myuser@gmail.com`
* Subject: `"My Subject"`
* Content: `"My Content"`
* Content Type: `text/plain`
+
. Add a Logger to the end of your flow that take a Message such as `"My Message"`.
. Deploy, Sync, or Run the app.
. To test the app, open `http://url.for.your.app:8081/incident/get` from a browser or from an app such as Postman.
. [Optional] Check your email inbox for the new message.
. Check your logs for any errors. If there are no errors, you should see INFO from your Logger Message, for example:
+
----
INFO 14:10:40 "My Message"
----
