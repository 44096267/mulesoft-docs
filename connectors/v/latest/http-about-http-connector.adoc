= HTTP Connector Overview
:keywords: connectors, http, https

Using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, the HTTP connector listens for a message or processes a request, depending on its configuration:

* Listener
+
Starts executing the Mule flow upon receiving a message from a source.
+
* Request
+
Processes an HTTP operation.

Mule preconfigures the first HTTP connector in an empty flow as a listener and trigger. When the app runs and the listener hears a request, the flow executes. You can set up the following operations for the second, or any subsequent, HTTP connector in the same flow:

* Execute HTTP methods, such as getting data, from a REST web service.
* Create an HTTPS listener.

// Load a static resource.

The HTTP connector defaults for listening to CloudHub using HTTP. For a request, the default port is 80, the method is GET, and the protocol is also HTTP. You can quickly configure an app to consume a web service using the two HTTP connector instances as follows:

* Listener configuration: Path = */somepath*, for example
* Request configuration: Path Or URL = the URL of the web service you want to consume
