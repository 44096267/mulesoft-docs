= Database Connection Pooling Reference

Establishing connections is costly in terms of connector and RDBMS network and processing overhead. The solution is to build a connection pool that provides a number of available connections. Pooling of database connections have special requirements. You use the database connector <db:pooling-profile> element instead of the standard Mule <pooling-profile> element.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the db:pooling-profile element:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:config name="dbConfig">
<db:my-sql-connection database="mozart_test" host="${host}" password="${password}" port="${port}" user="${user}">
   <db:pooling-profile acquireIncrement="1" maxPoolSize="5" maxWait="0" maxWaitUnit="SECONDS" minPoolSize="0" preparedStatementCacheSize="5"/>
 </db:my-sql-connection>
</db:config>
----

All connection configuration elements, except the global data source reference, accept the pooling profile. In JDBC, the pooling happens at the data source level itself. To do pooling, you have to configure the global data source. The software cannot add it on the fly. 

In Studio, in Database Configuration, click Advanced to configure connection pooling. In Pooling Profile, click Inline and accept the defaults or configure options.
