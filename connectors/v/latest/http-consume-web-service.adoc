= To Consume a REST Service 

You can integrate a web service into an application by setting up one HTTP connector as a listener and another as a request.

. In a new project, set up the HTTP connector to listen for a message from the browser to start this app: Use the default CloudHub HTTP configuration and set Path to */trigger*.
. Click + to add another component to the flow, and select HTTP Request.
. In HTTP Request, in General, set Path Or URL to *http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users*. Accept the other default settings and close the connector.
. Click Sync. Fire the app trigger:
+
* Select Running > Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client, and type */trigger* at the end.
+
The HTTP listener hears the request, and starts the app. The list of JSON Placeholder users appears in the browser.
+
. Open HTTP - Request, and go to Output. 
+
The list of users appears in Payload, and in Payload > Attributes, the attributes you can use in DataWeave expressions appear.
