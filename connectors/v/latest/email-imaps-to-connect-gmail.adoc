[[set_up_imap]]
. Add an IMAP-based Email operation (such as List Imap) to your flow.
. From the IMAP operation, click to Set Up the Email IMAP Configuration.
+
Note that in Anypoint Studio, you open a similar configuration window by selecting the `+` under Basic Settings in the General tab of the operation.
+
. Provide a Name for the configuration, for example, `My Email IMAP configuration`.
. In the General tab for the configuration:
+
* Select the `IMAPS Connection` type.
* Provide the Gmail host: `imap.gmail.com`
* Provide a Port: `993`
* Provide a User, for example: `myuser@gmail.com`
* Provide a Password, for example: `mygmailpassword`
* Set the Trust Store Configuration to `Insecure`.
+
. In the Advanced tab for the connection, Add and Save the following key/value pair to Properties:
+
* Key: `mail.imap.ssl.enable`
* Value: `true`
+
. Keep any default configurations that remain.
. Click Test (or Test Connection).
+
You should receive a response like this: `Test successful`
+
If the connection fails, check and Save your settings again.
