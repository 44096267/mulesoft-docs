[[short_description]]
Flow Ref routes the Mule Event output of one flow to another flow within a Mule application. It allows you to select an existing flow or create a new one.

Flow Ref is useful for breaking up your Mule app into discrete and potentially reusable units. For example, a flow that lists files or email on regular basis might reference another flow that processes the output of the List operation. Instead of appending all the processing steps, you can append a Flow Ref that points to the flow that processes the output.
