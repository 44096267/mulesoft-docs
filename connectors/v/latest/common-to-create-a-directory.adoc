:toc-title: To Create a Directory

You use the Create Directory operation to the File connector in a Mule app to create a directory in a local file system. If the directory already exists, the operation will return a `FILE:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS` error.

Note that if you are creating the directory to immediately  write, copy, or move contents to it, then you can use the Write, Copy or Move operations instead of using Create Directory. Those operations let you create parent directories for your files.

. After selecting the File connector, select the Create Directory operation for your flow.
. [Optional] Perform other tasks, for example:
  ** Provide a Display Name for the connector.
  ** Set up or select a configuration for the connector.
  ** Provide a reconnection strategy.
  ** Map custom error messages to error codes.
