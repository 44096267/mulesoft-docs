= Database Connector

The database connector establishes communication between your app and a relational database. The connector facilitates setting up the following databases for use in a Mule app:

* Derby
* MySQL
* Oracle

The connector supports the set up of other JDBC databases using a generic JDBC configuration. You need a JDBC driver for the database you want to connect.

The prerequisites for using the database connector are:

* Upload a JDBC driver for the database you plan to use during the configuration of the connector.

This process stores the connector in Exchange for reuse in other projects.
* Obtain the host name, port, and database user and password for connecting to the database.
