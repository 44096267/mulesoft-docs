= About Receiving HTTP Requests
:keywords: connectors, http, https

The HTTP connector's Listener receives requests via HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The request body is passed to the next element of the flow as the message payload while the method, headers, query parameters and so on are returned in the attributes as `HttpRequestAttributes`. You can access the attributes using DataWeave.

== About HTTP Requests and Responses

A request received by the Listener generates a Mule event. The connector outputs a Mule message on the event and you can refer to parts of it. The following diagram explains how each request part is mapped to a Mule event and how to access each.

You can read the request body mapped to the payload with DataWeave.

The response to a request can include the following information:

* Status code
* Reason phrase
* Body
* Headers

You can configure these responses for a successful or failed execution of the listener's flow. The former defaults present the payload as body and a yield a 200 status code. The latter defaults present the error description as body and yield a 500 status code.

== Securing Requests and Responses

You can use Transport Layer Security (TLS) and configure HTTPS by providing a key store with your certificate. You can also enable 2-way authentication by providing a trust store.
