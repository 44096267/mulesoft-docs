= About Receiving HTTP Requests
:keywords: connectors, http, https

The HTTP connector has a Listener operation that receives requests over HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Receiving a request generates a Mule event and passes the request body to the next element of the flow as the message payload. You can refer to parts of the Event output. The method, headers, query parameters, and so on are returned in the attributes as `HttpRequestAttributes`. 

== HTTP Request Mapping

The following diagram explains how each request part is mapped to a Mule event and how to access each.

You can read the request body mapped to the payload with DataWeave.

== HTTP Responses

The response to a request can include the following information:

* Status code
* Reason phrase
* Body
* Headers

You can configure a response for a successful or failed execution of the flow of the listener. By default, the former presents the payload as a body and yields a 200 status code. By default, the latter presents the error description as a body and yields a 500 status code.

== Securing Requests and Responses

You can use Transport Layer Security (TLS) and configure HTTPS by providing a key store with your certificate. You can also enable 2-way authentication by providing a trust store.
