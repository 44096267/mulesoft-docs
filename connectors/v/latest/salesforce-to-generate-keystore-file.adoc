The Key Store is the path to the keystore used to sign data during authentication. Only Java KeyStore format is allowed.

To generate a keystore file:

. Go to your Mule workspace, and open the command prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for Mac). 
. Type `keytool -genkeypair -alias salesforce-cert -keyalg RSA -keystore salesforce-cert.jks` and press enter.  
. Enter the following details: 
.. Password for the keystore. 
.. Your first name and last name. 
.. Your organization unit. 
.. Name of your city, state, and the two letters code of your county.
+
The system generates a java keystore file containing a private/public key pair in your workspace.
+
. Provide the file path for the Keystore in your connector configuration.
+
Type `keytool -exportcert -alias salesforce-cert -file salesforce-cert.crt -keystore salesforce-cert.jks` and press enter.
+
The system now exports the public key from the keystore into the workspace. This is the public key that you need to enter in your Salesforce instance.
+
. Make sure that you have both the keystore (`salesforce-cert.jks`) and the public key (`salesforce-cert.crt`) files in your workspace.
