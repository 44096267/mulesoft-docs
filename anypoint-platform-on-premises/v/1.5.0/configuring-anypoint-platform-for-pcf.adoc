= Configuring Anypoint Platform for PCF
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises


== Overview

For the Anypoint Platform for PCF solution to work, you must install the following things:

* The <<Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF Tile>>
* The <<Mule Runtime BuildPack>>
* The <<Space Configuration Tool>>. This installs a bundle of elements that includes:
** The Cloud Manager, which mediates the communication between Anypoint Platform and PCF
** The *Runtime Manager Service* - Meant for Mule runtime applications
** The *API Gateway Service* - Meant for proxying non-Mule applications that are deployed on PCF


[NOTE]
Each instance of the PCF Tile is linked to one PCF cluster, and every instance of the Space Configuration Tool is linked to one PCF space. Therefore, if you wish to manage multiple PCF spaces or multiple PCF clusters, you must also perform multiple installations of the Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF and the Space Configuration Tool to match these.
