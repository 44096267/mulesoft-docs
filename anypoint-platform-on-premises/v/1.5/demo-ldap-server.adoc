= Demo LDAP Server
:keywords:ldap, on-prem, on premises, external identity

== Overview

When you install the Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition, one of the steps on the wizard asks you to select an installation "flavour", allowing you to choose between a 1 server demo installation, a 3 server installation or a 6 server installation.  If you select a *1 server demo installation*, then the installer also automatically takes care of instantiating a demo LDAP server, and configuring the platform to use it. This document takes you through what this server includes.

Once the installer is done with the installation, you should be able to log into your Anypoint Platform installation with credentials from the test users in this LDAP repository.

== Data in the Test LDAP Server

The demo LDAP server is pre-populated with test data, which includes business groups and users.

The server is populated with two Business Groups:

. Marketing
. Sales

The server is populated with test 7 users, each with different roles within the different business groups:

. Organization Administrator
** User: `admin`
** Password: `Mule1234!`
. API Creator
** User: `apicreator`
** Password: `Mule1234!`
. Runtime Manager Administrator
** User: `ARMadmin`
** Password: `Mule1234!`
. Log Viewer
** User: `logviewer`
** Password: `Mule1234!`
. Marketing Business Group Administrator
** User: `MarketingAdmin` (limited to the Marketing business group)
** Password: `Mule1234!`
. API Portal Viewer
** User: `portalviewer`
** Password: `Mule1234!`
. Sales Business Group Administrator
** User: `SalesAdmin`  (limited to the Sales business group)
** Password: `Mule1234!`

== Testing the Installation

Once the installation is complete, you should be able to log in to Anypoint Platform with any of the test users covered in the section above.

. Open a browser and login into the Anypoint Platform using the *MarketingAdmin* user.
. If the LDAP configuration worked, you should reach the Anypoint Platform landing page:

. If you click on the list of business groups that the user belongs to, you should only see *Marketing*.

. Since the MarketingAdmin LDAP group is configured in this test organization as having the link:/access-management/roles[Roles] `Exchange administrator` and `Application Admin (Production)`. You can also verify that the logged in user actually is an exchange administrator by carrying out tasks in the link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange]. The same applies for the Application Admin role, which should let you deploy and manage applications on link:/runtime-manager/index[Runtime Manager].

. Log out, and log back in as the *SalesAdmin* user. Similarly, you should now only see *Sales* in the user's business groups.
