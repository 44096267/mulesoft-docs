= Getting Started with the Mule SDK

The following topics help you start developing Mule SDK projects.

== Setting Up Your Development Environment

You must have the following components installed and working in your local environment:

* Java Development Kit 8 (JDK 8) to compile and build your Java code.

* Apache Maven, version 3.3.9 or higher, to manage your projectâ€™s build

== Creating your first SDK project.

The SDK provides a Maven Plugin and a Maven Archetype to create new projects, an archetype is defined
as an original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made.

=== Generating a project using the Maven Plugin

There is a maven plugin with steps and descriptions for the required fields in order
to create a new Extension Project

By running the following command you will get prompt for values.

// TODO Test this, we need to provide the mule public repos to the user.
----
mvn extensions-generator:generate
----

=== Generating a project using the Maven Archetype Directly

You can also create a the project by invoking the archetype directly
with the following properties.

----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.mule.extensions
                       -DarchetypeArtifactId=mule-extensions-archetype
                       -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
                       -DgroupId=org.mule.extension.basic
                       -DartifactId=basic-extension
                       -DextensionName=Basic
----

=== The Generated Project
The generated project contains the basic mule <<1_structure/0_intro#_structure, module structure>> with some basic
classes with dummy implementation and two running tests that use's the generated
module.

As this project is a maven project contains a pom.xml file that with all the
information and configuration details used by Maven to perform the build, this
generated pom file inherits from the modules parent pom containing all the common
configurations and defaults for all mule module projects.

----
<parent>
  <groupId>org.mule.extensions</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-modules-parent</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</parent>
----

== Building the project
Once your project is generated you can build it by running the following command

----
mvn clean install
----

By executing this you will compile your project, run the tests and install it in
your local maven repository.

== Start Developing
Now you are ready to add your custom module code! Take a look to the detailed <<1_structure/0_intro#_structure, module structure>>
and the different elements that can be added to a module.
