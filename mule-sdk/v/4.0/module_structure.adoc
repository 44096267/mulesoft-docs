This section describes the basic elements of a Mule Module.



In the big picture we have:

* Components
** <<operations#, Operations>>
** <<sources#, Sources>>
** <<functions#, Functions>>
** <<routers#, Routers>>
** <<scopes#, Scopes>>
* <<connections#, Connection Providers>>
* <<configs#, Configurations>>
* <<parameters#, Parameters>>

Let's describe each of them shortly.

A diagram of a basic module structure.

== Components

It all starts with the Components, they are the key of a module functionality,
they work is given a set of parameters they can be executed altering or producing
the messages in a flow.

`Sources` and `Operations` are the most common components in a module. `Operations` are
components which process an incoming message and generate a result, `Sources` are another
type component which receives or generates new messages to be processed by the Mule Runtime.

// TODO LINK MESSAGE, LINK RESULT

== Configuration

`Configurations` are a set of configurable parameters which affect the behavior of the Module.
Both `Sources` and `Operations` typically depend on a `Configuration` to get parameters on how they should
behave, but this is not required, there are those which do not require a configuration and can simply
work on their own.

Modules are not required to have a configuration, but if they do, they can also define
as many other configurations as needed. Different configurations might not only provide
a different set of parameters, but also specify their own set of `Operations` and `Sources`
which are only available when using that configuration.

== Connection Providers

A `ConnectionProvider` is the Module element in charge of handling connections,
which are created from a `Configuration`. They centralize the logic and parametrization
to provision and release connections of some specific type.

Like the `Configurations`, `Sources` and `Operations` typically depend on a *connection*
in order to be executed, this is not required, but is pretty common. The *connections* used
by `Operations` and `Sources` will be provided for this `ConnectionProviders`.

`ConnectionProviders` are bounded to the `Configurations`. `Configurations` can have none, one
or many `ConnectionProviders` that creates different types of *connections*. For example:
a `ConnectionProvider` for HTTPS and another one for (non-secured) HTTP *connections*.

== Parameters

The `Parameters` are the most granular element on the module model and they are used
in all the described elements: `Operations`, `Sources`, `Configurations` and `ConnectionProviders`.

They represent the configurable elements that accepts the values then used for elements
to execute or just to hold the configured values.

== Other Elements

There are more element types that a module can have, for example: `Routers`, `Scopes`, `Functions` or
`Errors` between others, all of them are documented in a separated section. The ones
described here are the core elements that probably most modules will have.
