= APIkit 4.0 Beta Release Notes

These release notes briefly describe changes, known issues, and limitations in APIkit 4.0 Beta.

== Changes

* API Console no longer appears in Studio. The URL for launching the Console appears in the logs in Studio when you create an APIkit API. To launch the Console, enter the URL in a browser.
* APIkit now processes the operations declared after the APIkit router component.
* Only one of two 3.x-supported methods of configuring the Console is supported in this release.
+
You can configure the Console only from within the apikit:config element, as described in "Changing the API Console URL."
+
* Retrieving the RAML is supported from the Console, but not from the API.
* Generated XML code differs from that generated by APIkit 3.x. The XML code complies with new Mule 4.0 components as shown in the following snippets:

*3.x*: `<apikit:config name="api-config" raml="api.raml" consoleEnabled="true" consolePath="console" doc:name="Router" keepRamlBaseUri="false" />`

*Mule 4.0*: `<apikit:config name="api-config" raml="api.raml" outboundHeadersMapName="outboundHeaders" httpStatusVarName="httpStatus" />`

== Known Issues

* APIKIT-752 Examples should be generated taking into account the response mimetype.
* APIKIT-859 Form data and URL-encoded parameters are not validated.
* APIKIT-888 Includes with absolute paths are not resolved.
* CONSOLE-273 API Console does not render in IE.

A patch that fixes APIKIT-752, APIKIT-888, and CONSOLE-273 is available on request from MuleSoft Support.

* Non-blocking requests
* DataSense metadata
