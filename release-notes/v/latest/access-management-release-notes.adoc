*_Version 0.14.0_*

The Access Management V0.14.0 release makes minor improvements to Anypoint Platform's notifications about your Trial subscription period.

If you are in your 30 day trial period, you can see the expiration date under the *Subscription* section in the Access Management UI. After your trial period expires your account will be converted to a “Free” subscription tier where you will lose the ability to deploy apps and APIs along with other Enterprise functionality within Anypoint Platform. +
You will still be able to login to your account.

=== Hardware and Software Requirements

No change.

=== Compatibility

NA

=== Features and Functionality

Starting on August 27th, you will notice a *Grant MuleSoft Support access to my Anypoint organization* checkbox in the Settings section of your link:/access-management/[Access Management] panel. +
This checkbox will be enabled by default for your organization and business groups and grants our support team access to impersonate an user inside your organization or business group to troubleshoot Anypoint Platform issues.

To impersonate a user in your organization, the support engineer logs in as herself but gets the access permissions of the user being impersonated allowing her to see exactly what the  user sees and troubleshoot issues much faster. +
All the activity made by a MuleSoft support agent is logged and can be reviewed and filtered via the link:/access-management/audit-logging[Audit logging UI].
