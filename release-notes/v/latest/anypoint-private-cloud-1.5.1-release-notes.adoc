= Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition 1.5.1 Release Notes
*February 27, 2017*

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition takes all the power of the platform MuleSoft developed for the Cloud and enables companies to run the platform inside their data centers.  In this release we are simplifying the installation and configuration procedure, extending compatibility, and adding useful demo installation features.



== Features

=== API Manager

link:/api-manager[API Manager] is a multi-tenant end-to-end platform for enterprise API design, implementation, management, and engagement.

=== Anypoint Runtime Manager

link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager] enables users to enhance their unified monitoring experience by easily integrating their on-premises Mule servers and API Gateways with third partiesâ€™ monitoring tools, such as Splunk & ELK, for monitoring, analytics and governance.


The Private Cloud Edition of Runtime Manager is also enabled to deploy applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (Beta). See link:anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5/configuring-anypoint-platform-for-pcf[Configuring Anypoint Platform for PCF].


=== Anypoint Exchange

link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange] enables users to publish and access Mule-related content within their own organization increasing visibility and reuse across organizations.

=== Anypoint Access Management

link:/access-management[Access Management] is an underlying platform solution that allows customers to seamlessly integrate their existing authentication provider for centralized user management.



== System Requirements

See link:/anypoint-platform-private-cloud-edition/v/1.5/prerequisites-anypoint-platform-private-cloud[Prerequisites for Anypoint Platform] for installing the platform on premises.

== Current differences with the Cloud Version
There are some differences between the current On-premises release and the Cloud version.

* Runtime Manager doesn't include dashboards or insights
* Some alerts (related to server usage) aren't available

=== API Manager
* The *auto-deploy proxy* is not available via the UI for PCF
* Proxies can be automatically deployed to PCF via the command line

=== Other Differences
