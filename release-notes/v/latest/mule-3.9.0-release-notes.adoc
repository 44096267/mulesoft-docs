== Known Issue

CHHYBRID-1727
Mule Runtime 3.8.0 on-premises analytics does not work due to a bug in the Runtime Manager Agent 1.4.1 which is shipped with Mule 3.8. The workaround is to run the link:/release-notes/api-gateway-runtime-to-mule-3.8.0-migration-guide#syntax[gateway_domain_setup] script even if your application does not use a domain.
