== Version 3.9.0 New Features

Anypoint Connector DevKit 3.9.0 supports two new features for DevKit-built connectors, as well as several fixes from earlier versions.

Building a connector using DevKit 3.9.0 (i.e. specifying this version number in the connector project's `pom.xml`) allows the connector end user to retrieve information about the connector's `@Processor`(s) in the Mule Debugger in Anypoint Studio.

This version also allows the developer to package multiple sets of connector icons to be presented in Studio UI Visual Editor depending on connector end user's preference of Studio UI.
