== Compatibility

Anypoint Analytics is compatible with all hardware and software as described in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/hardware-and-software-requirements[Hardware and Software Requirements],
as well as Anypoint Platform for APIs v1.0 and newer.

== Version 1.10 - December 19, 2015

* To allow correlation between Anypoint Analytics and third-party systems, the `event_id` property
set by the API Gateway (from `message.id`) is now propagated through the system.
* Performing a sign out from the Analytics section of the Anypoint Platform now correctly signs out and redirects to the sign in page.
* OAuth tokens are now supported in addition to JWT for calling the Anypoint Analytics Query and Reports APIs.

== Version 1.9 - December 12, 2015

* Performance tuning in the ingest system, providing greater ability to handle burst load from API gateways.
* Improved presentation of empty data ranges for API analytics charts, making it more obvious when no data is available.
