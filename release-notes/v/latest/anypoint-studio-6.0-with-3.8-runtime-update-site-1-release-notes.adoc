== What's New

In this release, we have completed the maven support for domain within Studio. +
We recently released link:/release-notes/v/latest/munit-1.2.0-release-notes.adoc[MUnit 1.2.0], which includes domain support as one of the features. +
Our customers very often relies on Maven for MUnit automated testing, domain support within Studio removes frictions for _mavenizing_ projects and running MUnit tests.

In addition, we have also fixed various issues and improved the link:/quickstarts/implement-and-test#create-a-project-based-on-a-raml[API Import] / link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-sync-reference[Sync] feature introduced in 6.0.0.

== Migration Guide

For first time installment, please refer to link:/release-notes/anypoint-studio-6.0-with-3.8-runtime-release-notes#hardware-requirements[Studio 6.0.0 release notes] for hardware requirements and known issues.

From the previous versions of Studio 5.1.0, 5.1.1, 5.2.0, 5.2.1, 5.3.0, 5.4.1, 5.4.2 and 5.4.3, there is no special migration needed, but when opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the New Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.


[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.
