== What's New

In this release, we have made some changes regarding TLS support in Studio and embedded runtimes (Mule and API Gateway). +
Vulnerability of TLS 1.0 could potentially allow hackers to intercept and decrypt traffic between a user and a TLS-secured website. As TLS 1.0 is no longer accepted by PCi compliance, we have started to move towards enabling more users to adopt TLS 1.1+.

The specifics are as following: +
. API Gateway 2.1.1, 2.0.4 and 2.2.0 will only support TLS 1.1+.

. For other existing servers, including older versions of API Gateway and Mule, TLS 1.0 will still be the default and supported, so that there will be no forced migration. For upcoming Mule 3.8, we will also remove support for TLS 1.0. We encourage all users to start utilizing more secure protocols, and move away from TLS 1.0. For users who want to migrate from TLS 1.0 to TLS 1.1+ for better security, they can now do so within Studio following our link:/mulesoft-docs/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/tls1-0-migration[Migration from TLS 1.0 Guide].

. This update helps users configure TLS for HTTP-related connectors with appropriate setting. In the past, the default for all embedded servers was TLS 1.0, and it was difficult for users to migrate from TLS 1.0 to more secure versions. For TLS-related documentation, please refer to Support Resources section below.
In addition to this, we have also fixed various bugs, including

== Migration Guide

From the previous versions of Studio 5.1.0, 5.1.1, 5.2.0, 5.2.1, 5.3.0, 5.4.1 and 5.4.2, there is no special migration needed, but when opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the New Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.

[NOTE]
Studio as an Eclipse plugin only works with Eclipse 4.3 or 4.4 due to an SWT dependency.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.
