|Issue |Description
|MULE-9368 |System property mule.sftp.knownHostsFile is now removed. Instead, the file with the known hosts must now be provided through the mule xml config file, in the knownHostsFile attribute of the connector or the endpoints.
|MULE-9149 |mule-module-jbpm was removed from standalone and embedded CE distributions. Following libraries were also removed as they are not required anymore: hibernate-commons-annotations-3.2.0.Final.jar, hibernate-core-3.6.0.Final.jar, hibernate-jpa-2.0-api-1.0.0.Final.jar, jbpm-api-4.4.jar, jbpm-jpdl-4.4.jar, jbpm-log-4.4.jar, jbpm-pvm-4.4.jar, juel-engine-2.1.0.jar, juel-impl-2.2.1.jar, livetribe-jsr223-2.0.5.jar
|MULE-9337 |TLSv1 is no longer listed as an enabled protocol, by default only TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 are enabled. If you wish to use TLSv1 you can edit the TLS configuration file (tls-default.conf) and add it back to the enabled protocols entry.
|MULE-9334 |When an SQLException occurs while executing a query, all ResultSets from that DB connection (that is, multiple queries in the same transaction) that remain open are closed.
|MULE-9324 |When using a File inbound endpoint to poll a directory, an exception is thrown if the directory to be polled doesn't exist. That exception is handled by the System Exception Strategy.
|MULE-9204 |The default authentication method for a token request when using the oauth client credentials grant type now is basic auth (using client ID as user and client secret as password).
If the previous authentication method is desired instead, then the ""encodeCredentialsInBody"" attribute of the token-request element should be set to ""true""."
|MULE-9183 |Status code for successful one-way operations handled through CXF are 202 instead of 200
|MULE-9041 |The HTTP Connector leaves the inbound property http.remote.address with the actual remote address. If an X-Forwarded-For header is present, it is available as an inbound property.
|MULE-8963 |Exceptions that extend org.mule.api.MessagingException now receive the org.mule.api.processor.MessageProcessor that was executing in the constructor.
|MULE-8927 |The attributes that end in an endpoint URI (for instance smtp user and passwords) had to be encoded as a workaround for this issue. That workaround now has to be removed.
This also affects the result of MEL expressions (for instance, if an expression evaluated to a username with an @ char, it had to be encoded before using it), so a check has to be done to remove all the additional encoding that was placed for working this around.
|MULE-8626 |The HTTP Connector ignores a "Connection" outbound property when responding to a request (listener) or making one (request), instead of transforming it to a header. This means that: if such property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a response/request builder.
|MULE-8678 |The HTTP Connector ignores a "Host" outbound property when making a request, instead of transforming it to a header. This means that: if such property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a request builder.
|MULE-8676 |The HTTP Connector ignores a "Transfer-Encoding" outbound property when sending a response, instead of transforming it to a header. This means that: if such property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a response builder.
|MULE-8677 |The HTTP Connector ignores a "Transfer-Encoding" outbound property when making a request, instead of transforming it to a header. This means that: if such property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a request builder.
|MULE-8844 |When until-successful throws an exception, it now is a RetryPolicyExhaustedException wrapping the cause of the exception of the last try, instead of a MessagingException wrapping a RetryPolicyExhaustedException with no link to the actual cause.
|MULE-9044 |The HTTP Listener now returns a 400 instead of a 500 when an invalid Content-Type is sent on a request. Additionally, in both cases a response body is present.
|MULE-6298 |AbstractMessageSequenceSplitter#process now returns null instead of a VoidMuleEvent. This affects only the scenario where the elements of a split collection are filtered out.
|MULE-9306 |Losing flow and session variables when using MuleClient to dispatch/send an event. Exception strategy not caching exceptions after using MuleClient on a JavaComponent.
|MULE-9383 |HTTP Connector allows invalid Content-Type header values. In order to strictly validate them as before, use the mule.strictContentType=true system property.
|MULE-9405 |MuleException instead of NPE is now thrown when setting a null value for a context-property in an XstlTransformation.
|MULE-9533 |JMS Outbound endpoint does not respect response timeout.  Because the JMS outbound endpoint now uses the endpoint 'responseTimeout' attribute it no longer respects any timeout value set directly on the MuleEvent via API.  To mitigate this, configure the desired timeout via the 'responseTimeout' attribute on the endpoint element.
|MULE-9501 |The wildcard-filter only works with prefix (*.log), suffix (java.util.*) or enclosing strings (*util*) patterns, as well as the deprecated payload based filter (java.lang.Throwable+) and regular strings.
In any other case no match is possible, regardless of the input. The regex-filter should be used for other cases.
This also affects the wildcard patterns allowed by the file-wildcard-filter, request-wildcard-filter, expression-filter, message-property-filter, exceptions strategies commit-transaction and rollback transaction exception patterns, wildcard patterns used in expressions, among others.
