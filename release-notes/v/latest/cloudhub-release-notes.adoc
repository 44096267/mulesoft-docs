When an application that hosts APIs (including API proxies) is stopped, the API’s status within the API version details page appears as “active” even though it is stopped.
With enhanced logging enabled, to access an application’s log history past the most immediate 100 log lines, the instance logs need to be downloaded.

=== R40 Known issues

* If you deploy a newly created application from Studio to CloudHub, and then view the Settings page for that application, you may get a blank page. This can be remedied by creating your application in CloudHub first and then deploying from Studio.
