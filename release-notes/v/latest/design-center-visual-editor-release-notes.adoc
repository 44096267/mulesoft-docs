This beta release introduces the visual design editor to Design Center. The visual editor is an Anypoint Platform for designing an API in RAML. If you want to define a restful endpoint using a GUI instead of writing RAML code, the visual editor is the right tool to use. You can populate a GUI with values for resources, including resource types, relationships, and HTTP methods. The GUI then generates the RAML specification.

The editor prompts you to describe endpoints and formats the specifications with proper indenting.Â  The resulting RAML output file begins the API lifecycle and API design collaboration. API visual designer lowers the barrier to API specification languages.
