=== link:/release-notes/raml-1-early-access-support[Early Access RAML 1.0 Support]

This release introduces early access support for RAML 1.0 link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/raml-10/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md[specification]. The new version introduces several new features, listed in the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/raml-10/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/#whats-new-and-different-in-raml-10[RAML.org comparison of releases]. For those users migrating to RAML 1.0, see the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/wiki/Breaking-Changes[list of breaking changes] between RAML 0.8 and RAML 1.0

To support the latest version a new Java implementation of the parser is available. Refer to the https://github.com/raml-org/raml-java-parser/tree/v2[github project] to get access to the source code and the reported issues. APIKit relies on an alpha version of the parser that doesnâ€™t have full support of the specification yet. The following table lists the features gaps. Refer to the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-java-parser/blob/0.1.0-alpha-2/MISSING.md["RAML 1.0 features gap"] for updates.

|Text  | Parameter 
| uses key | The link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/raml-10/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#annotating-scalar-valued-nodes[spec] allows using uses in any fragment. At this moment the parser only allows its use in root level RAML documents and libraries.
| Annotations for scalar fields | The link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/raml-10/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#annotating-scalar-valued-nodes[spec] allows applying annotations to scalar nodes besides certain mapping nodes. Annotations at scalar level are not supported.
| Overlays restrictions | Overlay application is not enforcing all the required restrictions. The extra restrictions that Overlays enforce vs. Extensions are not being validated.
.2+| Security Schemes gaps | * OAuth 1.0 `signatures` setting is not supported
| * OAuth 2.0 `authorizationUri` is always optional, no matter which authorization grants are used
| XML Examples validations against YAML types | Validation of XML examples against types defined in YAML are not supported. XML validations are only supported for schemas defined in XSD format.
.8+| type system gaps | These features, related to the definition, are not supported:  
| * Inheritance of primitive types 
| * discriminator field 
| * Examples nested in a value
| * Xml Facet field
| * Additional properties
| * null type
| * Properties named with trailing question marks
