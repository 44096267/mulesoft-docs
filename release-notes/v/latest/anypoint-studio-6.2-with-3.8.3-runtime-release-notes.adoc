== What's New

This release adds support to On-Premise Edition of Anypoint Platform.

* For our On-Premises Edition customers, now they can configure their credentials and URL to let Studio connect to platform services hosted  on premises, such as APISync, API Autodiscovery and Exchange.

We also addressed a few enhancement requests based on customer feedback, such as:

* Support for Gzip Compress/Uncompress transformers in Studio
* Add application/java to list of default mime types in Json To Object Transformer

Additionally, the new release of MUnit (MUnit 1.3 runtime and MUnit 1.4 studio plugin) incorporates many significant improvements around Maven usability:

* We have dramatically improved the way our tests run from the Maven command line. MUnit runs now in a new VM. We’ve added a new set of features to our MUnit Maven Plugin, to allow the user to have as much control as possible. This provides support for running tests over applications using connectors who depend on native libraries (e.g. SAP). A short list of other new features are below:

** Run Tests in a separate VM.
** Allow setting argument lines from the Maven Plugin.
** Allow users to add/remove classpath entries from the Maven Plugin.
** Allow users to set environment variables from the Maven Plugin.
** Allow users to set the Mule Working Directory.
** Allow test output redirection of a file.
** Allow shutting down Surefire reports.

[NOTE]
--
If you are installing Anypoint Studio on a Mac computer with OS X that has no Java installed, the OS may require that you first download and install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JDK 1.6]. Install JDK 1.6 first and then install JDK 1.7.

== Known Issues

* Studio 6.2 does not support the following Mule 3.8 features:
** RecordVars and record payload should be editable in a commit block.
** Object Store support gaps around Idempotent Redelivery Policy, Aggregators and DevKit token manage
* Create JSON metadata from example does not support Big Integers
* When importing a zipped project related to the API Gateway's default domain (for example, proxies generated from API Platform), if the domain project does not exist in the workspace already, there is a chance that it will be generated incorrectly, resulting in an entry in the Package Explorer like "api-gateway_2_0_3 : ". The workaround is to delete the corrupt domain project and right click in the imported project -> Mule -> Associate with API Gateway domain, until the project is generated correctly displaying, for example, "api-gateway_2_0_3 : api-gateway".
* When changing API Platform environments from production to another environment, Studio would try to update offline projects, showing connection error marker. The workaround is to use different workspaces for each environment so that there will no be problem with users authentication.
* Folder decorators are not being shown correctly when users eliminate them. It shows them as modified and not as eliminated.
* When creating a new project with an invalid raml zip, Studio does not copy those files to the workspace.
* API Custom Policy Editing is a beta feature. We have a few known gaps.



[[migration]]
== Migration Guide

Users running Studio 6.0 can update to this new version directly from the Studio link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/studio-update-sites[Update Site]. +
If you are running an older version than Studio 6.0, you need to download a new full copy in order to update.

When opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the New Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.
