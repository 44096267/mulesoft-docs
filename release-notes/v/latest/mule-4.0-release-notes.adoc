* Customers who are interested in testing upcoming enhancements to Mule Runtime.
* Partners and community who are updating their Mule connectors and other materials

== What’s new?

== Gateway 4
Gateway leverages many of the improvements added in Mule 4. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/mule-runtime-updates[What’s New in Mule 4] for a complete overview.

* There is classloading isolation between the policies, the application and the runtime.
* Policies can be distributed outside of the runtime, providing frictionless upgrades
* All policies are non-blocking.
* All policies can be ordered. The only policy with a fixed order is CORS that it is executed first.
* Resource-level policy support has been extended to any HTTP API and not restricted to RAML based APIs.
* Custom policies can leverage Mule core concepts and language. See link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/custom-policy-4-reference[Custom Policy General Reference] (on `+https://docs.mulesoft.com/+`).

Note that Mule 4 is only supported on the new API Manager. See new API Manager documentation, link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/configure-auto-discovery-new-task#configuration-xml-element-for-mule-4[Configuration XML Element for Mule 4] (on `+https://docs.mulesoft.com/+`), for how to configure API Gateway.

=== Not supported on Early Access

* Exporting API Analytics to external analytics tool.
* Auto-generating and deploying proxies from API Manager.
* Throttling and Throttling SLA Based policies.
* Studio 7 doesn’t offer support for Gateway.
