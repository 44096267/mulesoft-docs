== Design Center 1.0 beta 4

=== New Features

*Flow designer*

* Support for new flow control components
** link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/choice-router-concept[Choice Router] enables you to make logical decisions and route to specific event processors or other flows.
** link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/for-each-scope-concept[For Each Scope] enables you to loop over payload content.
** link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/try-scope-concept[Try Concept] enables you to to incorporate link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/error-handling[Error Handling Logic] into your flows. Using error handlers, you can select specific error types that could occur, and define a behavior to deal with each.
** link:/connectors/flowref_about[Flow Refs] enable you to call out to other flows from your main flow.

* Support for REST connect, which provides a connector in the component selector for every API that is published in Exchange. This enables you to discover APIs as part of your design process and consume them without having to know the details of how the API works.
* A new card selector, which provides summaries of what the components do and enables you to quickly navigate to Exchange to see more information.
* Simplified HTTP experience: You can now use a URL directly, without needing to split the host and path into separate fields. There is also a suggested set of methods you can use.
* link:/design-center/v/1.0/user-access-to-design-center[Design environments] enable you to develop applications using flow designer, without consuming your Sandbox VCores.
* link:/design-center/v/1.0/manage-dependency-versions-design-center[Dependency management] enables you to manage the versions of your connectors and modules, so that you can upgrade or downgrade at any time.
* You can now rearrange flows by clicking on a card and dragging that card to a different location.
* Support for deleting event processors where the component no longer exists or is unknown, e.g. due to a version change where the operation no longer exists.
* Support for the Mule runtime 4.0 Beta release

*API designer*

* Suggestions “shelf” built into the RAML console for discovering RAML language syntax.
* An initial version of capabilities to create and delete branches for your API specification or fragment
* Edit and read-only mode for branches to avoid conflicts in collaboration
* Autosave capability
* New previews for markdown and JSON files
* Improved syntax highlighting
* RAML Parser bug fixes
* Improved API console
* Support for exporting OAS 2.0 documents



=== Known issues:

*Flow designer*

* TLS configuration fields are now available, but do not yet result in a valid CloudHub application.
* DataWeave does not support XML attributes yet

*API designer*

* Publish may occasionally fail with a "Exchange error: Not Found" and user needs to retry operation.
* Logout menu does not open inside API designer and user needs to go to Project List.
* RAML shelf does not always return complete list of suggestions for the cursor position.
* Query parameter examples are not sent unless modified inside the console TryIt.



== Design Center 1.0 beta 3

=== New Features

* Improved usability of the Live tab by splitting it into separate Input and Output tabs and reorganizing the layout
* Project cloning capabilities
* Improved support for operations without parameters
* Many bug fixes



== Design Center 1.0 Beta 2

We're excited to announce the release of beta 2 of Design Center. This release includes:

* A RAML editor for authoring and sharing RAML specifications.
* Support for Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0.
* A mocking service for testing APIs.
* Live view - helps you see your data as if passes through each component in your flows.
* Exchange integration - we are now pulling all the Mule Modules from Exchange, this makes it easier to scale and add more modules/connectors.
* Performance improvements - DataSense retrieves metadata faster now.
* Support for simple custom types - set a transform output to a String, Int, etc.
* Automatic HTTP listener setup - when you use an HTTP listener for the first time, a default CloudHub HTTP configuration is provided.
* Usability improvements - new side bar, cards no longer side scroll, they have a fixed size.
* Various bug fixes.


== Design Center 1.0 Beta 1

We’re very excited to announce the initial version of Design Center. This release includes the new web based Design Center, that enables users to easily create web based integration flows. With this release of the Design Center you can:

* Create and manage Mule Application projects
* Design flows using a simple step by step process
* Connect to systems and protocols using different connectors, including databases, FTP, HTTP, and SOAP web services.
* Perform complex data transformations using link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave[DataWeave] with a visual drag and drop editor
* Create and manage data types for XML, JSON, CSV and objects
* Store and retrieve information from the Mule Object Store

Underpinning this release is the initial release of Mule 4. This release is currently only available to Design Center users. More details on whats new in Mule 4 can be found in the link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/[Mule Runtime section].



== Minimum Requirements

The following browsers are supported for running the Design Center:

* Chrome (version 54.0.x)
* FireFox (version 50.0.x)

You must also have:

* An Anypoint Platform account
* At least one sandbox VCore, with 0.2 of its capacity still available.
+
[NOTE]
For the GA release, Design Center, will not need additional sandbox VCores.

* Your account must have the necessary link:/design-center/v/1.0/user-access-to-design-center[permissions] to use the Design Center.

== Limitations


With Design Center, you currently can't:

* Automatically build out an API backend based on a RAML API definition file
* Deploy directly to a customer-managed server (i.e.: a runtime outside CloudHub)
* Use TLS for secure protocols such as HTTPS and SMTPS
* Write custom code
* Use advanced functionality such as Spring or Maven
* Create Mule projects that run on a runtime version prior to 4.0.0
* Create flows that reference other flows or subflows. A project may have multiple flows but all of them are independent.
* Access resources (APIs, Database, FTP sites, etc.) that aren't accessible via the public internet or via your VPC.


[TIP]
All of these things can be accomplished with Anypoint Studio, our more advanced desktop eclipse-based IDE.
