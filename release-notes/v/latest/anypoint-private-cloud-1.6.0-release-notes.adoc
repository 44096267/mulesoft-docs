=== Anypoint Runtime Manager

* Mule messages
* Errors
* Response time

==== Runtime Manager 2.0.0

Insight for Hybrid Users: Insight gives users the ability to troubleshoot their applications for performance and health related issues at a granular level, thus enabling users to determine the root cause of an issue quickly and efficiently. This is now available for all users.

Flow Management: Users will have the ability to manage their problematic flows in runtime. They can now just disable a flow without disrupting the entire application.

Monitoring V2.0: This release contains granular monitoring charts for metrics that are pertinent to On-Premises servers and are hence used by Hybrid users.
The new charts include:

Garbage Collection

Heap/Non-Heap

Load average
