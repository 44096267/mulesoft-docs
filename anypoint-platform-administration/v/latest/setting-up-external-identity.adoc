= Setting Up External Identity
:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring

The Anypoint Platform can be integrated with your organization's external federated identity system. Opting to use federated identity management for the Anypoint Platform gives your users single sign-on access and facilitates OAuth security for APIs using the same identity management system.

The Anypoint Platform supports SAML 2.0 identity providers for user management, the following ones were successfully tested working with the platform:

* link:https://forgerock.org/openam/[OpenAM]
* link:https://www.okta.com/[Okta]

* link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb897402.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396[ADFS]

For all these providers, the 'Assertion Consumer Service' or 'SAML Assertion URL' is `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id` and the 'entityID' or 'Audience URL' it is any string value that identifies your organization. By convention is <organizationDomain>.anypoint.mulesoft.com, but any value is acceptable.

== Instructions for SAML Configuration

The instructions in this document allow you to configure your Anypoint Platform organization with any of the supported SAML 2.0 providers, so as to federate identity. There are two steps to follow:

. Configure your SAML provider to set up your Anypoint Platform organization as your audience.
. Set the 'Assertion Consumer Service' to send an HTTP POST request to the following address: `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id`
. Log in with an administrator account into your Anypoint organization, enter the settings section, and select 'External Identity'. If you haven't set anything yet, you should see a screen like this:

You must provide the following information in the form:
[width="100%",cols="35a,65a",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Issuer | ID of the identity provider instance that will send SAML assertions
|Public Key | Public key provided by the identity provider, used to sign the SAML assertion.
|Audience  | ID of the Service Provider (In this case, the Anypoint Platform). It's any string value that identifies your organization. By convention is <organizationDomain>.anypoint.mulesoft.com, but any value is acceptable.
|Username Attribute  | Field name in the SAML repository that maps to username. By default, the 'NameID' attribute in the SAML assertion is used.
|First Name Attribute  | Field name in the SAML repository that maps to First Name
|Last Name Attribute  | Field name in the SAML repository that maps to Last Name
|Email Attribute  | Field name in the SAML repository that maps to Email
|Group Attribute  | Field name in the SAML repository that maps to Group
|Sign On URL  | URL where users must sign in
|Sign Out URL  | URL to redirect sign out requests, so users both sign out of the Anypoint Platform and have their SAML user's status set to signed out

=== Configuring your PingFederate Environment

Follow the instructions within the link:http://documentation.pingidentity.com/display/PF610/Identity+Provider+SSO+Configuration[PingFederate documentation] to create a new PingFederate service provider. When configuring the service provider, ensure that you set these specific parameters as follows:

. Choose the Browser SSO Profiles connection template.
. Choose the Browser SSO as the only option that is applied to the connection.
. Configure the “Partner Entity ID (Connection ID)” as <organization domain name>.anypoint.mulesoft.com. You can find the value of <organization domain name> by navigating (as a user within the organization owner role) to the organization information page within the Anypoint Platform Web UI (click gear button on top right).
. Configure the Browser SSO as follows: +
.. For the SAML Profiles associated with your Service Provider connection, ensure that “IdP-Initiated SSO” and “IdP-Initiated SLO” are enabled.
.. From the “Assertion Creation” step, select “Configure Assertion Creation”. +
... Set the “SAML_SUBJECT” value to “urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified"
... Extend the contract for each of the following (new) fields, and set their format to be “urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic”: email, company, lastname, firstname
.. Configure your adapter to map the appropriate values to the fields listed in the step above.
. Within the “Protocol Settings” step:
...  Set the “Assertion Consumer Service URL” as follows.
... Keep default values except for binding, where the value must be “POST”.
... Set the “Endpoint URL” to `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id`. (If using Anypoint Platform on premises, replace `anypoint.mulesoft.com` with the base URL of your on-premises deployment.)
.. Ensure that the “Signature Policy” setting has the “Always sign the SAML Assertion” property checked.
.. Ensure that the “Encryption Policy” is set to “None”.
. Configure the Credentials.
.. Choose the Digital Signature Settings.
.. Pick a “Signing Certificate” to use for the digital signature.
... Export the certificate for use when submitting your information to MuleSoft through the PingFederate configuration form. (This is not necessary if your are using Anypoint Platform on premises.)
.. Select “RSA SHA1” as the signing algorithm.


=== Configuring your OpenAM Environment

Follow the instructions within the link:http://openam.forgerock.org/doc/webhelp/admin-guide/set-up-federation.html[OpenAM documentation] to create a new remote service provider. Then, perform the following steps:

. In the XML configuration file for the Service Provider, ensure that the SAML 2 metadata includes the following: +
.. `entityID`: The name of your organization, which you will provide to MuleSoft. The naming convention is `<organization domain name>.anypoint.mulesoft.com`. You can find the value of `<organization domain name>` by navigating (as a user within the organization owner role) to the organization information page within the Anypoint Platform Web UI (click gear button on top right).
.. Look for `AssertionConsumerService`, and set its values to the following:
+

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<AssertionConsumerService index="0" isDefault="true" Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST" Location="https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id"/>
----
+
(If using Anypoint Platform on premises, replace `anypoint.mulesoft.com` with the base URL of your on-premises deployment.)

. Configure the Remote Service Provider as follows: +
.. In *Federation*, select the Service Provider you want to configure. Ensure
 the *NameID Format* list includes the following value: 
+

[source,xml, linenums]
----
urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:unspecified
----

.. In *Assertion Processing*, configure the Attribute Mapper to map the following attributes to their proper values: `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `memberOf` (optional).
.. Ensure the Assertion Consumer Service marked as default is of type `HTTP-POST`, and its Location set to `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id` as defined in Step 1b. +

. Configure the identity provider to include the the user ID in the SAML assertion, e.g. by including the following in the NameId Value Map of the identity provider:
+

[source,xml, linenums]
----
urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:unspecified=uid
----

. Export the certificate used in your identity provider, which you will provide to MuleSoft through the OpenAM configuration form.

=== Providing MuleSoft the Information Required to Configure Your Anypoint Platform Organization for Ping Federate

[NOTE]
====
If all you want to use is link:https://documentation.pingidentity.com/display/PF66/Account+Management[user management], you can register your identity manager manually as explained in the sections above. If you wish to implement link:https://documentation.pingidentity.com/display/PF610/Client+Management[client management] then you must provide Mulesoft with more information as explained in this section.

If you are using Anypoint Platform on premises, you do not need to provide this information to MuleSoft.
====

If you want to use 'client management' and if you're not using Anypoint Platform on premises, you can't set this up manually, but you can request that your account is configured in that way. You need to work with your MuleSoft account representative to ensure that we are aware of your needs for configuring your organization with PingFederate. Complete link:https://docs.google.com/a/mulesoft.com/forms/d/16ZQjXcLmuXO8140svkjUxywzkZjv01GTgbf_3kfEebQ/viewform[the following form]. Once you have completed this form, we will get back to you within 48 hours with either the completion of the configuration or follow-up questions to complete the configuration.

[NOTE]
Having a single audience (an Anypoint Platform organization) served by multiple issuers (multiple SAML provider instances) is currently not supported.

== Role Mapping

You can set up your Anypoint Platform organization so that when a SAML user belongs to certain groups, it will automatically grant certain equivalent roles in the your Anypoint Platform organization.

To set this up:
. Log into your Anypoint Platform organization with an administrator user
. Go to the settings section and then select the 'Roles' tab
. Select a role to edit it and then click the 'Set external group mapping'
+
image:external-group-mapping.png[external group mapping]
. Provide the group names that will be associated with this role
