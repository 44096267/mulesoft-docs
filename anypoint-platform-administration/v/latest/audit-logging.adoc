Changes within an Anypoint Platform organization (e.g. the application of a policy or the creation of a new user) are logged through an audit logging service. The historical audit events for an organization can be accessed by users belonging to the Organization Administration role within a business unit.

Currently, access to this data is available through the Anypoint Platformâ€™s link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/apis/24562/versions/26089/pages/39846[Audit Logging Query API]. The information will also be made available within a dedicated UI page within the Anypoint Platform as part of a future release.
