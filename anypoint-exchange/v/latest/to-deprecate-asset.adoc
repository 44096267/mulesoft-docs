= To Deprecate an Asset in Exchange

Deprecating removes access to a version of an asset. The asset remains accessible for users. 
A deprecated asset can be reverted and returned to use.

. Click the Settings icon at the upper right:

. If you are an organization's owner or an Exchange Administrator, you can click Deprecate to indicate a version that is no longer valid or supported
that consumers still use. Deprecate lets you keep an asset available
that contains older versions that are no longer supported.
. Confirm the action when prompted, or click Cancel to exit the prompt.

After a version has been deprecated, users see this message:

You can click Revert to restore access to the version.
