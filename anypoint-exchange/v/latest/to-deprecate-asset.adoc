A deprecated asset can be reverted and returned to use.

. Click Deprecate to indicate a version that is no longer valid or supported
that consumers still use. Deprecate lets you keep an asset available.
. Confirm the action when prompted, or click Cancel to exit the prompt.

After a version has been deprecated, users see this message:
