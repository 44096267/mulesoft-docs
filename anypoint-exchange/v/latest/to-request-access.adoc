= To Request Access

You can associate an application with the current API. This lets the app access the API.

Note: If terms and conditions are set for an asset, users are prompted to accept the terms before Request Access can be granted.

. Click Request Access image:ex2-request-access.png[Button - Request Access in the task bar].  This button may be hidden in the three dot menu.
. In the Request API Access menu, if needed, click Create A New Application. 
. Choose the Application from the list of applications.
. Choose the API Instance from the list of APIs.
. Choose the service-level agreement (SLA) value for the application.
. Click Request API Access.

The Request API Access menu opens to show that the API access was successful. This screen also lists the client ID and client secret for this API access instance.

API Providers:

If a REST API does not have a Request Access button, go to API Manager and click Manage API > Manage API from Exchange to open the API. Use the URL of your API asset in Exchange as the Implementation URI in API Manager. After opening your API in API Manager, you can view the API Instance ID value as well as other useful information. To return to Exchange, click View API in Exchange. In Exchange, the Request Access button appears in the three dot menu. Note that in API Manager, the API's Status is marked as Unregistered. To register the API, deploy the API to Runtime Manager; however, changing the API Status to Registered is not required for the API to be usable in Exchange.
