== To Add Tags

Tags are strings that you add to identify aspects of an asset you created. Users type tag values as search strings to find one or more assets. For example, for a customer inventory program, you could have tags for customer, inventory, product types, region names where the inventory resides, and so on. Users can type a tag name to search for your asset in Exchange.

The tag strings can be any set of words. To choose an international character, hold the key down on your keyboard and choose from the character options that appear. A tag name is not case sensitive. Exchange converts tag names to lowercase.

To add a tag, click Tags > Add a tag: image:ex2-add-a-tag.png[ex2-add-a-tag]

== To Download an Asset

. Click Download in the taskbar: image:icon-download.png[icon-download]
. The results vary by file type:
+
* RAML or OAS: Choose the format As RAML or As OAS and Exchange downloads and if the original is in an
alternate format, converts the file to your choice. The output is a zip file.
* WSDL: Downloads your WSDL as a zip file.
* Custom, with a file: Downloads the same format file that you uploaded, but the file name is based on your application name. For example, if you upload a .txt file for the Inventory Distribution project, Exchange 
downloads inventory-distribution.txt.
* Custom without a file: The Download button does not appear.
