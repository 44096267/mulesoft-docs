== To Add Tags

Tags are strings that you add to identify aspects of an asset you created. Users type tag values as search strings to find one or more assets. For example, for a customer inventory program, you could have tags for customer, inventory, product types, region names where the inventory resides, and so on. Users can type a tag name to search for your asset in Exchange.

The tag strings can be any set of words. To choose an international character, hold the key down on your keyboard and other character options appear. The tags are not case sensitive. Exchange converts tags to lowercase.

To add a tag, click Tags > Add a tag: image:ex2-add-a-tag.png[ex2-add-a-tag]
