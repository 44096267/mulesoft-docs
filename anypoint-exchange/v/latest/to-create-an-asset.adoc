= To Create an Asset in a Private Exchange

In Anypoint Exchange, to share an API, example, template, or connector means that 
you need to create an asset first that respresents the asset type.

How you create an asset depends on its type.

* For an OAS, HTTP, or WSDL API, and for a custom asset, you create the asset in Exchange.
* For a RAML REST API, you first use Design Center and follow the steps to publish the API to Exchange.
* For an example or template, you create each using Anypoint Studio by using the Maven feature of Studio, which works with you to publish each to Exchange.
* For a connector, you get the source JAR, POM, and Studio Plugin zip for the connector and use the Node.js Connector Uploader application to publish to Exchange.

This illustration shows the asset types (in blue) and how each comes to be in Exchange:

== Creating an API Asset

An API asset specifies what an interface consists of including its functions, descriptions, how to handle return codes, and dependencies.

. Click New.
. Specify a name for the asset.
. Click the asset type from the drop-down list. 
+
Each asset type depends on the following:
+
* API Spec - OAS: Provide an OAS/Swagger API specification file.
* API Spec - WSDL: Provide a WSDL (SOAP API) specification file.
+
The HTTP API does not require a file, this type of asset provides an API endpoint 
that is defined by API Manager. 
+
. For the OAS and WSDL assets, click Choose File to locate the API specification file.
. Click Publish.

== Advanced Settings

Exchange generates the GroupId, AssetId, and Version automatically. You can change the values if needed. For an OAS asset, you can set the asset version and the API version separately. 

The Advanced settings are most often used to change the version number.

== Creating a Custom Asset

A custom asset lets you share information about any aspect of your organization such as announcements, documentation, videos, and sharing files. You can also choose a file to add to the asset that users can download.

. Click New.
. Specify a name for the asset.
. Click the Custom Asset Type.
. If you want to share a file with users, click Choose File to locate the file.
. Click Publish.
