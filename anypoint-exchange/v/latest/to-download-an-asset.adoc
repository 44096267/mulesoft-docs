The results vary by file type:

* RAML: Downloads a zip file of the RAML file.
* OAS: Click the down arrow image:ex2-icon-download-with-arrow.png[ex2-icon-download-with-arrow]
+
Choose the format As OAS or As RAML. If the original is in the
alternate format, Exchange converts the file to your choice. OAS downloads in the original format
of either JSON or YAML. A RAML downloads as a zip file.
+
* WSDL: Downloads the WSDL as a WSDL file.
* Custom, with a file: Downloads the same format file that you uploaded, but the file name is based on your application name. For example, if you upload a text file for the Inventory Distribution project, Exchange downloads inventory-distribution.txt.
* Custom without a file: The Download button does not appear.
