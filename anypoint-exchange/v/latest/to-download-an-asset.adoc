The results vary by file type:

Choose the format As RAML or As OAS, and Exchange downloads the specification. If the original is in the
alternate format, converts the file to your choice. The output is a zip file.
** WSDL: Downloads your WSDL as a zip file.
** Custom, with a file: Downloads the same format file that you uploaded, but the file name is based on your application name. For example, if you upload a .txt file for the Inventory Distribution project, Exchange 
downloads inventory-distribution.txt.
** Custom without a file: The Download button does not appear.
