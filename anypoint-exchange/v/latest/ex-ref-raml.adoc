= Referencing a RAML File

When using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-request-connector[HTTP Request Connector], you can reference a link:http://raml.org[RAML] file, which makes configuring the connector and the rest of your flow extremely easy. By referencing the RAML file, the connector offers you smart autocomplete options based on how the RAML file describes the available resources, methods and parameters. The metadata that the connector exposes can help you map it to other elements and reference its outputs elsewhere in the flow, specially with help from the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/dataweave[Transform Message Component].

. In an *HTTP Request Connector*'s properties editor, click the green plus sign next to Connector Configuration to create a Global Configuration Element for it.
. In the *General* tab, provide a *RAML Location*. You can reference a file stored in your local system, or you can use Exchange to browse a list of public APIs that have published their RAML definitions by clicking on *Search RAML in Exchange*:

. Navigate Exchange and look for the API you wish to connect to. You can either click the *View Details* button to read more about that API and RAML definition, or you can click *Add* to make your HTTP Connector reference it.

When referencing a RAML or Swagger file from a portal description, the *REST API Spec Version* is the version of RAML or Swagger you are using (0.8 or 1 for RAML, 1 or 2 for swagger), and the
*API Version* is the version of your API.
