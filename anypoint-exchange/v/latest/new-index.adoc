= Anypoint Exchange

Anypoint Exchange provides public and private views of assets. An asset provides information and download links for different types of Mule functionality, such as an example, temaplate, an API specification for OAS, RAML, or WSDL, and for connectors. The purpose of Exchange is to aid program development and create solutions using MuleSoft components.

The public view of Anypoint Exchange is self explanatory. You can view assets and descriptions, and download software. 

A private Exchange lets you provide assets specific to your organization. You can create your own Portal to create a private Exchange view with your logo, banner text, and content.
