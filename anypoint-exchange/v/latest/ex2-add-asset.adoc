== To Add Assets Using Business Groups

Anypoint Platform supports multiple business groups that you can use in Exchange. Any asset you add to a business group is available to other groups in your organization if you give permission for users to access the asset (not available in beta). However you cannot add assets between organizations or between business groups in different organizations.

To view business groups, click your organization name in the Exchange task bar. You can click other business groups in your organization to access each.

To add a business group, click the hamburger icon at the far left of the taskbar and click Access Management. In the 
Organization tab click the plus sign next to a business group name to add a new business group.
