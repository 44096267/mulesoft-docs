= To Query the Exchange Graph API
:keywords: query, exchange, exchange2, graph, api, graph api

The Exchange Graph API lets you search Exchange assets for a string value. You can specify what values
to receive from each search. The Graph API requires that you obtain an access token to conduct each inquiry.



== To Obtain an Access Token

. Log into Anypoint Platform.
. Obtain an access token with a curl command such as the following. You can also use Postman or another application for sending HTTP commands. 
+
*Note:* The access token times out after approximately 5 minutes, so you may want to create a shell script to obtain the access token. The access token time to live is not set by an organization's Default Session Timeout setting. 
+

curl -X POST \

  "password": "YOUR_ANYPOINT_PLATFORM_PASSWORD"

== To Run GraphiQL to Send a Query to Exchange

. Open GraphiQL program by browsing to https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/graph/api/v1/graphiql[https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/graph/api/v1/graphiql]. 
. In GraphiQL, click Query Variables at the bottom of the screen and insert the access token as:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "accessToken": "ACCESS_TOKEN_VALUE"
}
----
+
. Get a new access token if your query session exceeds 5 minutes.

The GraphiQL program provides these controls:

|===
|Button |Name |Description
|image:ex2-graphiql-run.png |Run |Send the query to the Exchange Graph API
|image:ex2-graphiql-prettify.png |Prettify |Strip out comments at the top of the file and collapse the JSON
as much as possible. This is not a toggle. If you want to see the comments again, run GraphiQL in another 
browser or in an incognito window.
|image:ex2-graphiql-history.png |History |List previous queuries. To dismiss the History pane, click History
again. 
|image:ex2-graphiql-docs.png |List a brief description about a parameter.
|image:ex2-graphiql-query-vars.png |Query Variables |Specify the access token value and any other variables to use 
in a query.

== To Search Assets for a Search Term

Insert a JSON block for your query in the upper pane of GraphiQL, such as the following example that searches for 
any asset with with the word "product" in the asset ID or description. GraphiQL searches all assets that are visible to the access token owner including MuleSoft and private Exchange assets.

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  assets(
    query: {
      searchTerm: "product"
    },
    latestVersionsOnly: true
  ) {
    assetId,
    description
  }
}
----

Output for this example is:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "data": {
    "assets": [
      {
        "assetId": "template-sfdc2sap-product-aggregation",
        "description": "Aggregate products (materials in SAP) from Salesforce and SAP into a CSV file."
      }
    ]
  }
}
----


== To Limits Searches to a Private Exchange

. Get the organization ID for the Private Exchange by clicking an asset in your Private Exchange.
+
An example URL is:
+
[source,xml]
----
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/42424242-42424242/product-api/1.0.0/
----
+
`42424242-4424242424242` is the organization ID.
+
. Add the organization ID using the organizationIds field in GraphiQL:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  assets(
    query: {
      searchTerm: "product",
      organizationIds: "42424242-424242424242"
    },
    latestVersionsOnly: true
  ) {
    assetId,
    description
  }
}
----
+
The output for this example is:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "data": {
    "assets": [
      {
        "assetId": "product-datatype",
        "description": "Product Datatype Asset"
      },
      {
        "assetId": "product-api",
        "description": "Product API Asset"
      }
    ]
  }
}
