:keywords: install connector, connector, install, studio, exchange

You can only install a connector by first starting Anypoint Studio and clicking the Exchange icon at the left on the Studio task bar. 

If a connector is already installed on your computer, the Installed button is grayed out in Exchange (accessed via Studio).

If a connector you need is not yet available for installation in Exchange, you can install the connector from Studio using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing-connectors[Help >Install New Software] menu.

The steps for installing Connectors from Exchange into Studio:

. Click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar:
