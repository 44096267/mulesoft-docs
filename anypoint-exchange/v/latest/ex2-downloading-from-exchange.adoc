|Asset Type |File Type |Download Action
|Connector |ZIP |To add a connector to Anypoint Studio:

. Unzip the zip file.
. Click Help > Install New Software.
. Click Add.
. In the Add Repository menu, click Local, click the folder containing the unzipped zip file, and click Open.
. Click the checkbox for the connector type, click Next, and follow the prompts to install the connector.
|Custom |Varies |By default a Custom asset type does not require a file. If a Custom asset is created without a file,
no Download button appears. If a Custom asset is created with a file, whatever file type you supply is what can be downloaded
with a new filename.
|OAS |JSON, YAML, ZIP|After creating an asset using API Spec - OAS, you can download the specification as either an OAS file, which is
either in JSON or YAML format depending on what file you used as input, or you can download an OAS specification as a RAML file. The RAML file outputs as a ZIP file.
|Example |ZIP |To add the example to Studio, click File > Import > Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archive.
|Module |-- |Cannot be downloaded.
|REST API |ZIP or JAR|Download as a ZIP file to add to a Design Center, or download as a Mule Plugin JAR file to add to an Anypoint Studio 6 project or Mule 3 application. See https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/adding-libraries[Adding Libraries].
|SOAP API |WSDL |You can use Exchange to create another project with the WSDL file. 
|RAML Fragment |ZIP |You can add the fragment to a Design Center > Mule Application. 
See link:/design-center/v/1.0/upload-raml-task[To Upload an Existing RAML File to Exchange].
