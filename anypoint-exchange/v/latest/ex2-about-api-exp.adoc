= About the Exchange API Experience

Anypoint Exchange provides resources for viewing APIs where you can 
navigate through your API's methods and functions within each method
to view descriptions and functionality as they appear in the 
REST API specification.

The API experience also provides access to the API Notebook feature 
that lets you share descriptions of APIs and enables users to test 
each function to expand their understanding of how each function works.
