= To Document an Asset Using API Notebook

. If you are documenting a RAML, use Design Center to improve and test your RAML, and Publish the API to Exchange.
+
If you are documenting an OAS specification, create a new Exchange asset and choose API Spec - OAS. Note: The OAS specification is converted into RAML so you can follow the RAML conventions for use with the API Notebook.
. Click the asset to view details.
. Click Edit and click the API Notebook icon image:ex2-api-notebook-icon.png[API Notebook icon] in the editor.
. Add the initial description for the asset. 
. In the Visual editor, the API Notebook icon creates a panel where you can add JavaScript code items. Enter the first letter of the function you want to add and Notebook lists the available functions starting with that letter. 
. Test the API in Exchange by setting elements in the code blocks and clicking Play. Ensure all code blocks 
work without causing errors in the code.
