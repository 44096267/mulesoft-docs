Anypoint Exchange provides a unified user interface and API for discovery and consumption of connectivity and assets.
Organizations can create private Exchanges and add their own content using any of the content types. This enables organizations to share information and custom assets. Through the use of Anypoint Platform business groups and 
environments, organizations can restrict who has access to each asset.

Anypoint Exchange:

* Works directly with Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio
to provide a single point of access for information and assets.
* Provides a central hub for discovering your organizationâ€™s APIs, best practices, templates, examples, and information.
* Provides listings of public and organizational APIs, connectors, examples, templates, and custom pages such as blogs videos.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.

== About Exchange Content

* Connectors - Anypoint Studio is preloaded with a large set of connectors, but the full listing can be found in Exchange. To install connectors, open Exchange from within Anypoint Studio. See link:/anypoint-exchange/ex2-studio[To Add Exchange Assets to Studio].
* Modules - Pluggable functionality, configured using a schema, but without an underlying transport to send or receive data.
* Templates - Packaged integration patterns that address common use cases and are built on best practices. Use case applications to which you add your information to complete a user case or solution. MuleSoft publishes Templates following  well-known design patterns. In a private Exchange, organizations can create zip file templates as needed.
* Examples - Implementations of Mule projects that explain development elements within Anypoint Studio and how these can be leveraged to achieve specific API and integration objectives. Examples are Mule application deployable archive (ZIP) files that are ready to run and demonstrate a use case or solution. You can import the example deployable archive into Studio, or you can deploy the example directly to a Mule runtime. 
* REST APIs - REST API definitions, often stored in RAML formatted files, that help make the adoption of the Anypoint Platform easier and faster. See link:http://raml.org[raml.org] for more information.
* RAML Fragment - A section of a REST API RAML file.
* SOAP APIs - SOAP API definitions stored in WSDL formatted files, that help make the adoption of the Anypoint Platform easier and faster.
* Custom - Blogs/Articles/Videos and more - Links that assist with knowledge sharing, such as information on DataWeave, MEL, batch processing, MUnit, policies, and links to knowledge sharing information sources.
