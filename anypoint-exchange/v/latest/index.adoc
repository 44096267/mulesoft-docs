Anypoint Exchange consists of two uses, a public list of APIS, examples, 
connectors, and templates that you can use to create applications. Exchange also provides private Exchanges that organizations can use to share their APIS, examples, connectors, templates, and custom assets for creating applications
within their organization. Private Exchange assets enable Anypoint Platform users to publish and access Mule-related content within their organization increasing visibility and reuse.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
