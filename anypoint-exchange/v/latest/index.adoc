* Exchange public - Discover hundreds of reusable connectors and templates provided by MuleSoft and its partners.

Exchange also lets users test REST APIs with an interactive interface that sends requests and receives responses.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
