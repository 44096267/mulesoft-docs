Anypoint Exchange provides listings of public and organizational APIs, connectors, examples, templates, and custom pages such as blogs videos.

*Note:* Exchange 2 Beta only supports use with the Chrome browser.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. 

All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
