https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] consists of two views, a public list of APIS, examples, 
connectors, and templates that you can use to create applications. Using Exchange is straightforward - click an asset to view more information. If you are viewing a REST API, you can see the API's functions and experiment by 
sending requests and viewing responses right in Exchange.

Exchange also provides private Exchanges that organizations use to share their APIS, examples, 
connectors, templates, and custom assets for creating Mule applications
within their organization. Private Exchange assets enable Anypoint Platform users 
to publish and access Mule-related content within their organization increasing visibility and reuse. 

Private Exchanges can also be personalized as Exchange Portals for an organization to show its logo, banner image, and welcome message.
