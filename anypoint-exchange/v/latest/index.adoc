== About Storing Assets

Anypoint Exchange does not store or host an organization’s assets. Exchange provides a platform-wide interface for discovering and consuming the assets, but assets must be stored in external repositories.

Typically organizations store their assets in existing organizational repositories such as:

* Source code repositories, such as GitHub or Atlassian Stash
* Artifact repositories, such as Nexus or Artifactory
* Content Management Systems (CMS), such as Wiki or SharePoint
* API portals
* Other internet based resources, such as web sites

== About Certification

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. 

All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
