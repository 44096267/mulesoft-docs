= About Exchange Portals

Exchange Portals enable organizations to create a customized public Exchange view 
with an organization-specific logo, banner image, text, and a favicon for the browser tab.

Exchange portals are public on the internet and are used to 
externalise an organization's APIs to outside developers.

Organization users can log into the portal to customize the look and content of the portal.

Exchange Portals let an organization share custom applications and custom pages.
