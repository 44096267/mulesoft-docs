Anypoint Exchange lets you publish design tools that
others in your organization can reuse to improve and
design their solutions. Exchange provides both public
and private assets that enable an organization to 
use each in applications.

You can search Anypoint Exchange for a name, summary, 
or description, or click *Type* to filter the view to 
only those items in the Type list.

Display assets by icons image:icon-display.png[icons] 
or as a list image:list-display.png[list]. 

The list view also lists the type, date modified, rating, 
and which organization role created the asset.

Exchange lets you discover all public assets, those from MuleSoft, 
and private assets that you create for your organization.

For APIs you can also view the link:/api-manager/engaging-users-of-your-api[API Portal.]
