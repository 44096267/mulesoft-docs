= About Administration Tasks

Anypoint Exchange provides those with the Exchange Administrator capabilities not shared with Exchange Contributors 
or Exchange Viewers. 

You can perform the following tasks as an Exchange Administrator:

* link:/anypoint-exchange/to-set-permissions[Set Exchange role permissions] - Determine who in your organization should 
be an Exchange Administrator, Contributor, or Viewer. You can also provide role access for individual assets.
* link:/anypoint-exchange/to-enable-the-request-access-button[Use API Manager to add the Request Access button] - This
enables you to specify which API assets can be shared with users.
* link:/anypoint-exchange/to-deprecate-asset[To Deprecate an Asset] - Remove access to a version within an asset but keep the asset available. Users can access other versions within the asset.
