= To Migrate Assets from Exchange 1 to Exchange 2
:keywords: exchange, migrate, migration, exchange 1, exchange 2, anypoint exchange

Anypoint Exchange 2 introduces a new way of working with your assets. Where Exchange 1 is a listing service that only provides links to where assets are stored, Exchange 2 is a package management system that stores assets. 

Migration to Exchange 2 differs by asset type:

Entitlement is required to view the API designer in the Design Center. You can request access by submitting a case to Customer Support for migration purposes only.

== Example: Publish Using the Maven Facade

The Maven Facade lets you migrate connectors, examples, or templates. To use this feature, you need to upload the JAR (or zip) file containing your asset and the pom.xml file via the API. For more information, see link:/anypoint-exchange/ex2-maven[To Publish and Deploy Exchange Assets Using Maven].

Add the Maven Facade as a repository in the distribution management section of your project's pom.xml file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

 <name>Asset name</name>
 <description>Asset description</description>
 <properties>
   <type>connector</type>
 </properties>

[...]
 <distributionManagement>
   <repository>
     <id>Repository</id>
     <name>Corporate Repository</name>
     <url>https://maven.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/maven</url>
     <layout>default</layout>
   </repository>
 </distributionManagement>
[...]
</project>
----

Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with your organization ID. 

See link:/anypoint-exchange/ex2-maven#vieworgid[To View Your Organization ID].

Create a settings.xml file inside your ~/.m2 folder that holds the settings that the Maven client uses to run. You need to configure your credentials for the Exchange Maven Facade:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
 <servers>
   <server>
     <id>Repository</id>
     <username>anypointadmin</username>
     <password>anypointadmin</password>
   </server>
 </servers>
</settings>
----

Publish your releases to Exchange using Maven deploy, for example, using the CLI:

`mvn deploy`

=== To Consume with Maven

Add the Maven Facade as a repository in the repositories section and the asset you want to depend on to the dependencies section of your pom.xml file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                     http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
[...]

 <dependencies>
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
     <artifactId>mule-module-sfdc</artifactId>
     <version>8.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
 </dependencies>

[...]

 <repositories>
   <repository>
     <id>Repository</id>
     <name>Corporate Repository</name>
     <url>https://maven.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/maven</url>
     <layout>default</layout>
   </repository>
 </repositories>
[...]
</project>

Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with your organization ID.
