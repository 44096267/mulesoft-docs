* GroupId - Unique group ID value the same as a package name that identifies the path across projects. This is the same as the Maven group ID, and lists your domain name,
such as com.mulesoft.

* Version - Current asset's version. This is a string value that must be in the format: _major.minor.patch_, such as `1.2.3` or `42.54.42`.

group ID value is unique. You can set this in the Access Management > Organizations menu.
