=== About Storing Assets

Anypoint Exchange does not store or host an organizationâ€™s assets. The Exchange provides a platform-wide interface for discovering and consuming the assets, but assets must be stored in external repositories.

Typically the assets themselves are stored in existing organizational repositories such as:

*	Source code repositories, such as GitHub or Atlassian Stash
*	Artifact repositories, such as Nexus or Artifactory
*	Content Management Systems (CMS), such as Wiki or Sharepoint
*	API portals
*	Other internet based resources, such as web sites
