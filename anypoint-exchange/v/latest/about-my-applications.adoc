= About My Applications

The My Applications area in the Exchange details view for an asset lists
applications that hold a contract between an API and a user.

These applications result when users click Request Access to establish 
a link between an application and an API. Either the application already exists, 
or the user creates the application from the Request Access menu.

Applications in My Applications are registered using API Manager in Anypoint Platform.
