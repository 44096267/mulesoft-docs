== Specify a Logo

Choose a logo image file. The maximum logo height is 60 pixels with a proportional width. 

The image file format can be .svg, .png, .jpg, or .gif.

== Specify a Favicon for the Browser Tab

Choose a favicon image to appear in the browser tab for your portal. The maximum size for the image depends on 
browser requirements. The favicon.ico file can contain up to 5 sizes, such as 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, and 512x512. 

== Change the Hero Image Banner

Choose an image for the banner for your portal. The image file format can be .png, .jpg, or .gif. The maximum file size
for the banner image is 2 MB.

The image you specify is stretched to fit the window size as determined by the browser.

== Change Text Color

Specify the hexadecimal red-green-blue color for the text for your portal in the range of #FFFFFF for white to #000000 for black. At least 3 hex characters must be specified, for example, specifying #F42 generates a value of #FF4422. The field is not case sensitive.

== Add a Custom Page

Custom pages appear as tabs at the top of the portal. Use the Exchange Visual or Markdown editor to add text, images, or videos to a page.
