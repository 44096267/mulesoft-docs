= About Sharing Assets in Exchange

You can use a Private Exchange or an Exchange Portal to share Mule XML example code, templates, connectors, REST and WSDL APIs, and Custom information assets. Sharing assets helps your organization model and reuse code and APIs for ease of access and to provide a repository.

Exchange provides an editor to add descriptions, videos, and links to an asset, as well as an API Console to experiment with sending requests and receiving responses from REST API asssets. The API Notebook built into Exchange also lets you share information about each REST API method so users can experiment interactively with the API by changing variables and running it in the notebook.

== Sharing Assets by Type

Asset types are in blue. You can share OAS API, WSDL (SOAP) API, and HTTP API assets directly in Exchange, whereas an example and template publish in Exchange from Studio, a RAML from Design Center, and a connector using the node.js connector-uploader.

Exchange also lets users review assets so that asset providers can get feedback.
