= About Sharing Assets

You can use Exchange private or Exchange portal to share Mule XML example code, templates, connectors, APIs, and custom information assets. Sharing assets helps your organization model and reuse code and APIs for ease of access and to provide a repository.

Exchange private makes it easy to share share assets with internal developers by givin them viwer, contributor or admin access. Additionally, assets created within a Business Group are automatically shared with developers within that Business Group. 

Exchange public enables Exchange admins to share assets externally with developers ourside of their own organization.

Exchange also lets users review assets so that asset providers can get feedback.
