= About Sharing Assets

You can use Exchange private or Exchange portal to share Mule XML example code, templates, connectors, APIs, and custom information assets. Sharing assets helps your organization model and reuse code and APIs for ease of access and to provide a repository.

Exchange private provides an editor to add descriptions, videos, and links to an asset, as well as an API Console to experiment with sending requests and receiving responses from REST API assets. The API Notebook built into Exchange also lets you share information about each REST API method so users can experiment interactively with the API by changing variables and running it in the notebook.

Exchange also lets users review assets so that asset providers can get feedback.
