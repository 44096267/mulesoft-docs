= About Sharing Assets in Exchange

You can use a Private Exchange or an Exchange Portal to share Mule XML example code, templates of Mule XML, connectors, REST and SOAP APIs, and Custom assets for information. Sharing assets helps your organization model and reuse code and APIs for ease of access and to provide a repository.

Exchange provides features such as an editor to add descriptions, videos, and links, as well as an API Console to experiment with sending requests and receiving responses from REST API asssets. The API Notebook built into Exchange lets you share information about each REST API method so users can experiment with the API by changing variables and running it in the notebook.

From Exchange Portals you can create a site for your organization and share assets for your private Exchange.

== Sharing Assets by Type

Asset types are in blue. You can share OAS API, WSDL (SOAP) API, and HTTP API assets directly in Exchange, whereas an example and template publish in Exchange from Studio, a RAML from Design Center, and a connector using the node.js connector-uploader.

Exchange also lets users review assets so that asset providers can get feedback.
