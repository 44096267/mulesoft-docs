= To Update Component Versions (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart

You can update an existing project to use a different version of a dependency without losing what you configured on it.

Connectors and other components that are versioned independently from the Mule runtime are considered dependencies.


Here are the steps to update a project that has at least one dependency, such as a connector:

. Click the Dependency icon image:manage-dependency-versions-design-center-d96c7.png[] on the left side bar.

+
A list of all dependencies and their versions is used in your project is shown.

. Hovering over a dependency, click the Options icon image:manage-dependency-versions-design-center-018a5.png[] and choose Change Version > _version number_.

. Verify the updated component's configuration in your project. What you had previously configured should persist, unless the version changes affect those fields.
