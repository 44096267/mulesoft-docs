= To Update Components of the Flow (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart

This procedure covers how to update dependencies, which are connectors and other parts of the flow that are versioned independently from the Mule runtime. You can update an existing project to use a different version of a dependency without losing its configuration. However, if the change to the version affects configuration fields, you might need to change those settings as described in the release notes.

. Click the Dependency icon image:manage-dependency-versions-design-center-d96c7.png[] on the left side bar.

A list of all dependencies and their versions is used in your project is shown.

. Hovering over a dependency, click the Options icon image:manage-dependency-versions-design-center-018a5.png[] and choose Change Version > _version number_.

. Verify that configuration has not changed.
