= To Manage Dependency Versions (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart


Connectors and other components that are versioned independently from the versioning of the Mule runtime are considered Dependencies. You can update an existing project to use a different version of a dependency without loosing its configuration.


Once you have a project that includes at least one dependency, for example a connector:

. Click the Dependency icon image:manage-dependency-versions-design-center-d96c7.png[] on the left side bar.

+
A list of all the versioned items used in your flow is shown with their respective versions.

. Hover over one to reveal the options icon image:manage-dependency-versions-design-center-018a5.png[] , click it and select Change Version.

. Select the version you want to migrate to.

. Verify the updated component's configuration in your flow. What you had previously configured should persist, unless any fields were renamed in the new version.
