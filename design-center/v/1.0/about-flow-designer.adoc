= About Flow Designer
:keywords: mozart

== Overview

The flow designer is one of the tools in the link:/design-center[Design Center]. It's a simplified web-based visual design tool that allows you to create and deploy Mule applications very easily. It can be thought of as a subset of link:/anypoint-studio[Anypoint Studio] (the desktop IDE) that is streamlined to require minimum configuration. With a strong focus on usability, the flow designer allows you to get things done with very little effort and without needing to go deep into learning the underlying concepts. It's oriented towards users that, whilst having a general technical background, don't need to understand Java or advanced connectivity concepts.

The flow designer allows you to build upon reusable assets, enabling anyone who needs to put together an integration to compose applications in a self-serve manner. You can combine both out-of-the-box components and those that have been created by integration specialists in your organization.

The flow designer's editor allows you to directly deploy your applications to CloudHub without ever leaving the screen. It also periodically deploys your project to a sandbox environment for debugging purposes. When ready, simply promote the application to the Production environment, all without ever leaving the editor.



[NOTE]
To use the flow designer, your Anypoint organization needs to have at least one CloudHub sandbox link:/access-management/environments[environment] in it, and your user must have a link:/access-management/roles[CloudHub developer role] in the used environemnt. This is required to deploy and test applications as you develop them, before they're ready to promote to a production environment.

== Export to Studio

If you need to set up more advanced configurations on your Mule project, you can easily export it to link:/anypoint-studio[Anypoint Studio] and open it in this more powerful editor.

To do so, simply click the *Export to Studio* icon on the top nav bar

This generates a full-fledged Mule application, packaged as a .zip file. To learn how to import this file into Anypoint Studio, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/importing-and-exporting-in-studio#impoting-projects-into-studio[Importing and Exporting in Studio]


[NOTE]
Make sure you configure Anypoint Studio in your machine to be linked to your Anypoint Platform organization    ...do you have to?
