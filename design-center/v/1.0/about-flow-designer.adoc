ONLY AFTER EXCHANGE SUPPORTS IT

The flow designer allows you to build upon reusable assets, enabling anyone who needs to put together an integration to compose applications in a self-serve manner. You can combine both out-of-the-box components and those that have been created by integration specialists in your organization.

You can deploy your applications directly from Flow Designer either to a sandbox environment for debugging and reviewing or to your production environment.

== Export to Studio

If you need to set up more advanced configurations on your Mule project, you can easily export it to link:/anypoint-studio[Anypoint Studio] and open it in this more powerful editor.

To do so, simply click the *Export to Studio* icon on the top nav bar

This generates a full-fledged Mule application, packaged as a .zip file. To learn how to import this file into Anypoint Studio, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/importing-and-exporting-in-studio#impoting-projects-into-studio[Importing and Exporting in Studio]
