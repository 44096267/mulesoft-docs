:keywords: mozart

As a tool in Design Center, Flow Designer is a web-based visual design tool that allows you to create and deploy Mule applications. You do not need to understand Java or advanced connectivity concepts to use Flow Designer.

ONLY AFTER EXCHANGE SUPPORTS IT

The flow designer allows you to build upon reusable assets, enabling anyone who needs to put together an integration to compose applications in a self-serve manner. You can combine both out-of-the-box components and those that have been created by integration specialists in your organization.

You can deploy your applications directly from Flow Designer either to a sandbox environment for debugging and reviewing or to your production environment.



[NOTE]
To use the flow designer, your Anypoint organization needs to have at least one CloudHub sandbox link:/access-management/environments[environment] in it, and your user account must have a link:/access-management/roles[CloudHub developer role] in the used environment. This is required to deploy and test applications as you develop them, before they're ready to promote to a production environment.

== Export to Studio

If you need to set up more advanced configurations on your Mule project, you can easily export it to link:/anypoint-studio[Anypoint Studio] and open it in this more powerful editor.

To do so, simply click the *Export to Studio* icon on the top nav bar

This generates a full-fledged Mule application, packaged as a .zip file. To learn how to import this file into Anypoint Studio, see link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/importing-and-exporting-in-studio#impoting-projects-into-studio[Importing and Exporting in Studio]


[NOTE]
Make sure you configure Anypoint Studio in your machine to be linked to your Anypoint Platform organization    ...do you have to?
