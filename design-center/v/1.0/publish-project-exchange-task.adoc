= To Publish an API Design Project

This procedure describes how to publish a project of type API specification or API fragment to Exchange for reuse. When you open an existing project in Design Center, the UI that appears depends on the type of project: A flow appears in a Mule application project. A RAML editor appears in an API specification or API fragment project.

. In Design Center, select an API specification or API fragment project.
+
. Click Publish to Exchange image:publish-exchange.png[Publish to Exchange icon].
. The names of the project and main file appear. 
+
The valid indicator appears below the main file. Do not continue unless the file is valid.
+
. In Tags, type the name of a tag or accept the default tag named example. The tag appears as a prominent label for this publication in Exchange.
. Accept other defaults, if there are any. 
+
API specifications can include advanced information: Group ID, Asset ID, and Version.
