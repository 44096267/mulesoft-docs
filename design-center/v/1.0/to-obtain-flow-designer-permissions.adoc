== To Obtain Flow Designer Permissions



* In order to access the Design Center and flow designer, your user account must have a `Design Center Developer` role assigned.
* To use all of the features in flow designer and deploy applications to a test sandbox environment, this user must also have a link:/access-management/roles[CloudHub developer role] for the sandbox environment.
* For that user to be able to deploy to production from the editor, the link:/access-management/roles[CloudHub developer role] is also needed in the production environment.

[TIP]
If you need to assign this set of roles to multiple users, you could create a link:/access-management/roles#creating-custom-roles[custom role] that includes all of the above. Then you only need to assign this single custom role to each.

[NOTE]
Note that roles are assigned per environment. Multiple roles are needed for having the same permissions in separate environments.
