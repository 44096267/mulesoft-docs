== To Obtain Flow Designer Permissions



Your user account must have a `Design Center Developer` role

Your user must have a link:/access-management/roles[CloudHub developer role] in the used environment

[TIP]
Alternatively, if you need to assign this set of roles to multiple users, you could create a link:/access-management/roles#creating-custom-roles[custom role] that includes all of the above. Then you only need to assign one role to each.



[NOTE]
Note that roles are assigned per environment. If your organization has multiple environments (such as QA, production, etc), you must have these roles in every required environment.
