= To Deploy a Project
:keywords: mozart, flow designer, deploy, environments

The flow designer allows you to easily deploy applications straight from the editor, without needing to leave the editing screen. You can use this as a way to test and debug your application as you develop it, periodically deploying it to sandbox environments to check that it works as expected. When your application is finished, you can also use this feature to deploy your application to a production environment.

[NOTE]
To deploy your application, your Anypoint Platform account must have at least one CloudHub worker with 0.2 Vcores available.

== Deploy to Sandbox


. The flow designer deploys your application to a sandbox environment on link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] as soon as it's error-free.

. As the application is deployed, its status is indicated next to it as it changes from *Undeployed* to *Deploying* to *Running* or indicates any errors.

[TIP]
====
Each application that you develop in Design Center is linked to a CloudHub worker, and deployed to it under the same name as your Design Center project. Once deployed, it becomes reachable through a URL that follows the structure *appName.cloudhub.io*.

The full URL to your project is displayed on the nav bar, and you can copy it to clipboard by clicking the dropdown button and selecting *Copy link*.

====

. As you make changes, these are periodically updated in your deployed application.

. Once deployed, you can also configure finer details about the deployment through the link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] pannel. To do so, click the dropdown next to the status and select *view in runtime manager*.

== Update an Application

The flow designer regularly updates changes to your deployment. You can also trigger this manually by clicking the *Update button*.


== Restart an Application

To pause the application, select *Pause* in the dropdown next to the deployment status. Note that this keeps the workerspace active and the CloudHub resources in use.

== Restart a Workspace

To restart the CloudHub worker where your application is running, click the dropdown button next to the status and select *restart workspace*.

== The Deployment Panel

You can edit and view more details about your deployment through the *Deployment Panel*, to open it click the corresponding icon:

On this panel you can view the deployment console, which displays details about the current state of the deployment as well as specific error messages.

You can also change the name of the app on CloudHub, which also changes the address with which your service is exposed.

== Promote an Application

Once you consider your application is ready to publish, you can promote it to a different environment.


. Click the *Promote Application* button on the top navbar image:deploying-your-project-a675b.png[]

. Select a name under which to deploy your application and the CloudHub link:/access-management/environments[environment] in which to deploy.

. Set up the link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-global-configurations[Global Configurations] of your project for this new environment.

+
The fields exposed in this screen are the same as those that can be set in the link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-global-configurations[Global Configurations] of each element in your flow.
+
This allows you to tweak your application with values and credentials that may point to similar assets that exist in the new environment. You may have – for example – a staging database for your staging deployments, and a production database for your production deployments. This eliminates the need to add property placeholders.

. After deploying, you can go to the Runtime Manager console and link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applciations[manage your application] in the same way as any other.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that CloudHub applications are deployed to a specific link:/access-management/environments[environment] (i.e: Dev, QA, Production).

Make sure you're aware of the consequences of deploying to the selected environment, as by deploying it you might be giving your app more exposure than you want to give it at the time.

== Deploy To Other Servers

For deploying to customer-managed Mule runtimes (all except CloudHub), you must first export your project to Anypoint Studio, and then export a .zip deployable archive from there.  (link)
??? still true??   now we have a full fledged app
