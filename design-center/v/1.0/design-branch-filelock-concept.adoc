= About Design Sharing and Migration

When you want to share or copy your API design, you can create a branch off the master branch of the project. You keep the master branch clean by working in branches. Branching facilitates migrating versions of designs and making revisions.

Initially, you create a branch of a design from the Master dropdown.

From any subsequent branch, you can create child branches.

== Branch Locking

During collaboration on a design, contention inevitably arises. A locking mechanism restricts access to a branch by allowing only one user at a time. Access to the project is not locked. Access to a copy of the locked branch is always available. If you get the lock to a branch, other users can still open and view the project. Users can also view or edit other branches of the project after you have obtained the lock.

The locking mechanism works only on the following project types:

* API Specification 
* API Fragment

When multiple people attempt to access the branch, one acquires write access on the data. Others are given read-only access. When you try to access an in-use branch, a banner at the top of the RAML editor says the file is read-only. Click the Edit to open the branch for editing if nobody is using it. 

You acquire write access to a branch in the following situations:

* Trying to access a branch that nobody is using other than you
* Creating a project and selecting API Specification or API Fragment
* Clicking Edit in the Read-only banner above the RAML editor

If you acquire write access and are idle for 10 minutes, you lose the lock.
