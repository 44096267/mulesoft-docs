= About API Fragments and Revisions

An API fragment is a RAML document that has a version and an idenfier, but is not in itself a complete RAML specification. An API frament is of one of the following types defined by RAML.org:

* Trait
* Resource Type
* Library
* Type
* User Documentation
* Example
* Annotation Type
* Security Scheme

You can publish an API fragment to Exchange, include fragments as dependencies in a project, and revise a fragment. After revising a fragment, update API specifications that use the fragment to include the new version.

To make any design, API specification or fragment, that you design available for use by others, you need to publish the design to Exchange.
