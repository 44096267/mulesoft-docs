== About Global Configurations

By design, Mule applications keep the reusable configurations of connectors separate from the definition of individual instances of them. This is achieved through link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/global-elements[Global Elements], which exist outside any flow, but that can be referenced by elements in them.

In this way, when creating a project that utilizes several instances of a same card, these parameters only need to be provided once and can easily be globally changed.

For example, you could have multiple HTTP connectors in your project, all of them relying on the same host and port and implementing the same SSL certificates, but each triggering a different flow via a different subpath.

== Create a Global Configuration


. Add a connector to your flow, it will notify you that a configuration is required through an error message on the top margin.

. Click the *Set up* link to create a new global configuration for that card.

. Give your configuration a *Configuration Name*. This will come in handy if you want to apply this same configuration to another similar element in your project.

. Provide any other necessary fields and click *Save*

[NOTE]
If you create any new cards of the same type in your project, these will automatically reference the existing global configuration unless you specify otherwise.

== Edit a Global Configuration
