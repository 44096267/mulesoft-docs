. Select the link:/access-managemnet/environments[target environment] for your application (ie: Development, QA, Production). Through the use of multiple environments, you can keep your works-in-progress safely away from the public eye until they're ready to be promoted to production.


[NOTE]
A known issue exists that prevents you from renaming an existing project in the project list. Name changes don't persist.
