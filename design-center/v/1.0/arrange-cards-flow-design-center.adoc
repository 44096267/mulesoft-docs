= Arrange Cards to Build a Flow (Design Center)
:keywords:


Flows are composed of component that are chained together, where each sends its output to the next. Each of these component is represented in Design Center by a card.

Each flow must have a trigger that sets it into action, either by receiving an outside event (like an HTTP request) or by waiting for a specific date or time. As an exception to this rule, a flow that is meant to be referenced by another doesn't need to have its own trigger.


== Add a component


* To add a first component to your flow, select from the menu that appears when you first create the flow.
* To add a component at the end of your flow, click on the plus sign at the end image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-e256e.png[], then select a component.
* To add a component between two existing ones, hover over the arrows in between image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-d6a6a.png[] to reveal a plus sign and click it, then select a component.


Some tips for navigating the component menu:

* You can use the search box to find a component by name.
* A dropdown menu on the top lets you filter through categories of components.
* When hovering over a connector in the list, an information icon image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-014d5.png[] is displayed. This links to the Exchange page for that connector, where you can learn more about it.



== Working with Scopes

Scopes can be added to your flow like any other component. These don't perform any actions on their own, they're buckets in which you can place other components. By adding components inside a scope, their behavior is affected by the scope in ways that depend on what scope you're using.

To add a component inside a scope, click the plus sign image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-e256e.png[] that appears inside the scope.

You can add as many components as you want inside a single, you can also nest scopes inside other scopes.

== Reorder Components

If you want to change the order in which the components in your flow are executed without loosing their configuration, you can do so by dragging them and dropping them onto another position in the flow.
