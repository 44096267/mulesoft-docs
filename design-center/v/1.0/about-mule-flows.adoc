== Overview

[TIP]
Refer to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-concepts[Mule Key Concepts] for an overview of basic Mule Runtime concepts.


In the flow designer, the components that compose Mule applications are represented as _cards_. Each component receives an input, carries out a specific function and then passes out an output to the next one. These are chained together into link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-concepts#flows[flows].

You can have several flows in a single project. Each flow is executed independently of each other. Every flow has a trigger that sets it into action, this can either be a connector that is externally called, or a poll which actions your flow at a given time or interval.


When you create a new Design Center app project, you're immediately prompted to select the component that triggers your first flow.

You can then build up the rest of your flow, by adding more components that are executed after the first one is triggered. The order in which they are placed matters, as information flows through them from left to right. To view the metadata that describes this information at every point of the way, see link:/design-center/v/1.0/about-data-types[About Data Types].

You add steps to a flow by clicking the plus icons that are next to and in between the existing cards in your flow. To add a new card in between two other cards, hover over the arrow that joins them to reveal the clickable plus icon.

This opens a list of eligible components, from which you can pick which to add in that position of the flow. This list includes all the basic components, as well as APIs taken directly from your organization's link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange2[Exchange], exposing content that's created by integration specialists in your organization.

[TIP]
Advanced users can define what assets are made available on the flow designer via Exchange. For example, if you have a custom API for Salesforce and want everyone in your organization to use that instead of the regular Salesforce connector, you can restrict the regular connector's use.

You can create multiple flows in a single project, add a new flow by clicking the plus sign at the top:

You can also rename and delete existing flows through the menu on the left:

== Card Configuration

You can click on any card in a flow to open its settings panel. There, you'll find specific settings that pertain to that instance of that element.

Many components require that you reference global configuration elements, see link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-global-configurations[To Set Up Global Configurations] to learn how to create and reference these.

[TIP]
See link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-populate-fields[To Populate Fields] for details on how the flow designer UI can make this easier.
