= Export a Project to Anypoint Studio (Design Center)
:keywords:


You can download the source of your Design Center project to a file. This file can then be imported into Anypoint Studio.

Anypoint Studio, the Eclipse based editor for Mule applications, allows you to configure many advanced options and to edit the XML code of your application directly.

[NOTE]
Note that projects exported from Design Center are only supported by Anypoint Studio version 7.x and above, that support Mule runtime version 4.x.

. In Design Center, once there are no errors marked in your project, click the download icon image:export-studio-design-center-24d8a.png[] and select Download Source.

. A .jar file is downloaded by your browser to the default location in your local disk.

. In Anypoint Studio, make sure your installation is configured with your Anypoint Platform organization user and password. For this go to Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Authentication.


. In Anypoint Studio, go to File > Import and select Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archive.
