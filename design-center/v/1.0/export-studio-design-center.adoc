= Export a Project to Anypoint Studio (Design Center)
:keywords:


You can export a project from Design Center to a file, that file can then be imported into Anypoint Studio. Anypoint Studio, the Eclipse based editor for Mule applications, allows you to configure many more advanced options and to edit the XML code of your application directly.

[NOTE]
Note that projects exported from Design Center are only supported by Anypoint Studio version 7.x and above, that support Mule runtime version 4.x.

. In Design Center, make sure there are no errors in your project, then click the Export to Studio icon image:export-studio-design-center-6106a.png[].

. A .zip file is downloaded by your browser to the default location in your local disk.

. In Anypoint Studio, go to File > Import and select Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)
