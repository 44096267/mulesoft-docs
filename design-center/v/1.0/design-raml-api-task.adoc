= To Design a RAML API Specification

// tech review by Christian, week of mid-April 2017 (kris 4/18/2017)

This procedure covers how to design an API that consumes the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder. The API has two resources: `/users` and `/usersbyid`. You can call the API to request information about all users, or using an HTTP query parameter, to request information about a particular user.

. In Anypoint Platform, click Design Center, and in Projects click Create. In New Project, set up a project:
+
* In Project Name type a name for your new project. For example, type placeholder.
* In Project Type, select API Specification.
The project opens for design in the master branch. Two lines of code based on the title and version of the API appear in the RAML editor.
+
. In the RAML editor, go to the next blank line (3).
+
The possible entries you can make appear as options. Click to enter and correctly indent an option into the code.
+

+
If you don't see these options, click image:down-angle-bracket.png[down angle bracket].
+
. At the root level, click Root > baseUri from the list of options. Enter 
`+baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`.
+
. Go to the next line of code, and include a resource in the RAML. Indent the resource at the same level as the `baseUri`.
+
For example, create a `/users` resource:
+
----
...
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
----
+
. Enter the GET method to retrieve the information defined in `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`. Put the method name followed by a colon on the lines below the resource name, indented one level.
+
. Include HTTP responses in the RAML for simulating the API:
+
----
responses:
      200:
        body:
----
+
At this point, the API definition looks like this:
+
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users
    responses:
      200:
        body:
----
+
. Download the `user-example.json` from the "Downloads" section of this document and create an include file of the JSON code:
* Select Files > + > New File.
* Select Other from the drop-down and name the file *user-example.json*. Click Submit.
* In the Editor, enter the following code for the content of user-example.json:
+
----
[{
              "id": 1,
              "name": "Leanne Graham",
              "username": "Bret",
              "email": "Sincere@april.biz",

                "geo": {
                  "lat": "-37.3159",
                  "lng": "81.1496"
                }
                },
              "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
              "website": "hildegard.org",
              "company": {
                "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
                "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
                "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
              } }]
----
+
* Refer to the include file in RAML:
+
----
...
      application/json:
        example: !include user-example.json
----
. At one indentation from the root, define the following resource:
+
----
  /userbyid:
    get:
      description: Get information about a particular user
      queryParameters:
        id:
          description: Specify the id of the user you want to retrieve
          type:        integer
          required:    false
          example: 3
      responses:
        200:
          body:     
            application/json:

In the "To Simulate Calling an API" topic, you see how to call the API to get user information.
