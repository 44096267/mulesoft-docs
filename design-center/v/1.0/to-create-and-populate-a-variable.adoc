= To Create and Populate a Variable


Variables are a way to pass data along a flow to the next component.


Variables belong to a Mule event, and can only be accessed as that individual Mule event is processed through the flow, they are not stored.

[NOTE]
Unlike in 3.x versions of Mule runtime, only one type of variable exists in Mule 4.x.

== Create with the Transform Component

. Add a new Transform Component to your flow and open its properties

. On the output section, click the dropdown next to the output label (it should display "Output Payload" by default), and select *Add Transformation*.

. In the *Type* field, pick "Variable", and then give a name to your new variable.

. The transform card now displays the transformation that outputs into your new variable. If you don't want to carry out an additional transformation to the payload of the Mule message, then you should delete the default transforamtion. To do so, Click the dropdown next to the output label and click the trash can icon image:to-create-and-populate-a-variable-85dfe.png[] next to *Payload*.

. Define a Data Type for your variable

. Map values to it from the input


Your new variable is created and populated with data from the input. The following components on your flow should now be able to access or edit it.

== Create with Other Components

Follow these steps to create a new variable in your flow. Note that this doesn't provide a value to it.

. Select the *Data Types* tab of the component where you want to create the variable

. Click the *Add* button next to _Variables_

. You're prompted to provide a name and a type for the variable. If you have already defined any custom data types in your project, you can select one of those, or otherwise click *New* to link:/design-center/to-manage-data-types#custom-data-types[create a custom data type].
