= To Create and Populate a Variable (Design Center)


Variables are a way to internally pass data along a flow to the next component. Variables belong to a Mule event, and can only be accessed as that individual Mule event is processed through the flow, they are not persisted anywhere.



== Create a Variable With an Operation


. Open any operation that isn't acting as a flow trigger (ex: an HTTP request operation).

. Select the *Advanced* tab of this operation.

. In the *Target Variable* field, write the name of your new variable.

////
. Optional: open the *Output* tab of the operation (on the top margin), select the newly created variable and assign a Data Type to it.
////

This creates a new variable and populates it with the data that's returned by the operation. For example: on an HTTP request operation, the response of the sent HTTP request is recorded onto the variable, instead of overwriting the payload.


== Create a Variable With the Transform Element

. Add a new Transform Component to your flow and open its properties

. On the output section, click the dropdown next to the output label (it should display "Output Payload" by default), and select *Add Transformation*.

. In the *Type* field, pick "Variable", and then give a name to your new variable.

. The transform card now displays the transformation that outputs into your new variable. If you don't want to carry out an extra transformation that outputs to the payload in this step, then you should delete the default transforamtion that the card created when you added it. To do so, open the dropdown next to the output label and click the trash can icon image:to-create-and-populate-a-variable-85dfe.png[] next to *Payload*.

. Define a link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-manage-data-types[Data Type] for your variable

. link:/design-center/v/1.0/graphically-construct-mapping-design-center-task[Construct a Mapping] of values from the input into your new variable.


Your new variable is created and populated with data from the input. The following components on your flow should have access to it.
