= To Create and Populate a Variable


Variables are a way to internally pass data along a flow to the next component. Variables belong to a Mule event, and can only be accessed as that individual Mule event is processed through the flow, they are not persisted anywhere.

[NOTE]
Unlike in 3.x versions of Mule runtime, only one type of variable exists in Mule 4.x, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/mule-concepts[Mule Concepts].

== Create a Variable

. Add a new Transform Component to your flow and open its properties

. On the output section, click the dropdown next to the output label (it should display "Output Payload" by default), and select *Add Transformation*.

. In the *Type* field, pick "Variable", and then give a name to your new variable.

. The transform card now displays the transformation that outputs into your new variable. If you don't want to carry out an extra transformation that outputs to the payload in this step, then you should delete the default transforamtion that the card created when you added it. To do so, open the dropdown next to the output label and click the trash can icon image:to-create-and-populate-a-variable-85dfe.png[] next to *Payload*.

. Define a link:/designer-center/v/1.0/to-manage-data-types[Data Type] for your variable

. Create a link:/design-center/v/1.0/totransform-data[mapping] that maps values from the input into your new variable.


Your new variable is created and populated with data from the input. The following components on your flow should have access to it.

== Create an Empty Variable

As an alternative, this shorter set of steps lets you create a new variable too. Note that this doesn't provide a value to it.

. Select the *Data Types* tab of the component where you want to create the variable

. Click the *Add* button next to _Variables_

. You're prompted to provide a name and a type for the variable. If you have already defined any custom data types in your project, you can select one of those, or otherwise click *New* to link:/design-center/to-manage-data-types#custom-data-types[create a custom data type].
