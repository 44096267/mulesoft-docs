= To Use Conditional Logic

You can create flows that branch out into different paths depending on certain conditions. This is similar to using if/else statements in most popular programming languages.

You achieve this by placing components on the different branches of a Choice component. Each branch follows a condition, conditions are evaluated from top to bottom. The branch of the first condition to be evaluated to true is used, all others are ignored.


. Add an HTTP listener to a new flow and set its path to *choicetest*

. Add a Choice component to go after it in the flow.

. Click the If card and set the Expression to the following condition: *attributes.queryParams.lang == "es"*.

+
This expression is true only when the incoming HTTP request includes a query parameter `lang=es`.

. For more clarity, give the If card a friendly name. Write *Spanish* in the Display Name field.

. Click the plus sign next to the If card and place a Logger component. Set its message to *"Hola Mundo!"*.

+
This component is only used when the expression in the If card is true.

. Click the plus icon image:conditional-logic-task-design-center-5c567.png[] next to the card labeled Default.

+
Any components you add here are used only when none of the conditions in the If cards are true.

. Add another Logger component. Set its message to *"Hello World!"*.


. Open the If card and click the Options menu on its top-right corner image:error-handling-task-design-center-018a5.png[]. Select Add Below to add another choice path.

. In the newly created If card, set the Expression to the following: *attributes.queryParams.lang == "fr"*. Set its Display name to *French*.

. Click the plus sign for the French branch and place another Logger component. Set its message to *"Bonjour Monde!"*.

. Run your application by clicking the Run button in the top nav bar. Once running, click the dropdown menu next to the status and select *Copy Link*.

. Paste this link in a new browser and add */choicetest?lang=es* at the end.

. Go back to your application and open the Logs tab at the bottom of the screen. A new log line should display the text "Hola Mundo!".

+
See what happens when you send HTTP requests with the lang parameter set to *fr* or without a lang parameter at all.
