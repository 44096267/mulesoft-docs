= Managing Flows Reference (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart

Every flow has a trigger and the trigger executes the flow. The trigger can either be an operation that is externally called, or a Scheduler which executes your flow at a given moment or time interval.

After creating a new Mule Application Design Center project, you're prompted to select the trigger. You select a trigger from the list.

To add another component to be executed after the first is triggered, you click the plus image:flow-designer-c760b.png[].

To add another component between two existing cards, hover over the arrow that joins them to reveal the clickable plus icon. A list of eligible components is shown. You can pick which to add.

////
This list includes all the basic components, as well as APIs taken directly from your organization's link:/anypoint-exchange/[Exchange], exposing content that's created by integration specialists in your organization.

Some things you add to a flow need configuring.

[TIP]
Advanced users can define what assets are made available on Design Center via Exchange. For example, if you have a custom API for Salesforce and want everyone in your organization to use that instead of the regular Salesforce connector, you can restrict the regular connector's use.
////

You can have multiple flows in a single project. Each flow is executed independently of each other. To add a new flow, click the plus sign at the top of the left bar:

To rename or delete an existing flow in your project, select the flow and click the options icon next to it:
