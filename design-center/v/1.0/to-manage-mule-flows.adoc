= To Manage Mule Flows
:keywords: mozart


== Overview

In the flow designer, the components that compose Mule applications are represented as _cards_. Each component receives an input, carries out a specific function and then passes out an output to the next one. These are chained together into link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-concepts#flows[flows].
The order in which they are placed matters, as information flows through them from left to right.

You can have several flows in a single project. Each flow is executed independently of each other. Every flow has a trigger that sets it into action, this can either be a connector that is externally called, or a poll which actions your flow at a given time or interval.



== To Set Up a Flow


. After creating a new flow designer project, you're immediately prompted to select the component that triggers your first flow. In this list you're presented only with the components that are capable of functioning as a trigger. Select one.

. Add another component to be executed after the first is triggered. To do so, click the plus icon: image:flow-designer-c760b.png[]

[TIP]
To add a new card in between two existing cards, hover over the arrow that joins them to reveal the clickable plus icon.

. A list of eligible components is shown, from which you can pick which to add. This list includes all the basic components, as well as APIs taken directly from your organization's link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange2[Exchange], exposing content that's created by integration specialists in your organization.

. Most cards have required fields in them that need to be set up. Click on a card to open its settings panel. There, you'll find specific settings that pertain to that instance of that element.

. Many components also require that you reference global configuration elements, see link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-global-configurations[To Set Up Global Configurations] to learn how to create and reference these.

[TIP]
Advanced users can define what assets are made available on the flow designer via Exchange. For example, if you have a custom API for Salesforce and want everyone in your organization to use that instead of the regular Salesforce connector, you can restrict the regular connector's use.
