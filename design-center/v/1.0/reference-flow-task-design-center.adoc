= To Reference Another Flow (Design Center)


By placing a Flow Ref component in a flow you can references another flow in your Mule project. When this component is executed, it triggers the referenced flow into action. When the referenced flow is done executing, the original flow continues where it left off after the Flow Ref component. This is useful for reusing groups of components, you can define them once in a separate flow, and then reference that flow from multiple other places.


+
[NOTE]
You can only reference flows that exist in the same Mule project.

. In Design Center, build out a first initial flow by adding components.

+
Make sure this flow starts with a trigger, such as a scheduler or an HTTP listener.

. Create a second flow in your Mule project by clicking the Plus sign next to Flows on the left nav-bar.

. Rename both of your flows to make them easier to identify. To do so, click the Options icon image:reference-flow-task-design-center-b93f3.png[] next to each flow name, and select Rename.


. Return to your first flow by clicking on its name in the left nav-bar.

. Add a Flow Ref component anywhere in this flow. In the Flow field, select your second flow.

. Go to your second flow by clicking its name on the left nav-bar or by clicking the Go button on the Flow Ref component. Build this second flow out by adding components.
+
Don't add a trigger to your second flow, as it's meant to be triggered by the Flow Ref.
+
When your first flow is triggered, data is processed through this flow till the Flow Ref component is reached. Then the entire second flow is processed, and finally the components in your first flow that come after the Flow Ref component are processed (if there are any).



== Set Metadata for a Flow

You can define metadata for an entire flow describing its expected input and output. A Flow Ref element that references this flow would then expose this metadata to the rest of the flow it's in. This might be useful while you build your app, specially if you include Transform components.

To set this:

. Click the Options icon image:reference-flow-task-design-center-b93f3.png[] next to each flow name in the left nav-bar, then select Edit Types.

. Set the metadata for the different parts of the input and output of the flow, by either selecting existing data types or adding new ones.
