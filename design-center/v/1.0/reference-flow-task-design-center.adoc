= To Reference Another Flow (Design Center)


You can make a flow reference another, so that the execution of one then calls the other. You achieve this by adding a Flow Ref component on a flow. This is useful for reusing groups of components, by referencing one same flow from multiple places.


+
[NOTE]
You can only reference flows that exist in the same Mule project.

. In Design Center build out your initial flow by adding components.

+
Make sure this flow starts with a trigger, such as a scheduler or an HTTP listener.

. Create a second flow in your Mule project by clicking the Plus sign next to Flows on the left nav-bar.

. Rename both of your flows to make them easier to identify. To do so, click the Options icon image:reference-flow-task-design-center-b93f3.png[] next to each flow name in the left nav-bar, and select Rename.


. Return to your first flow by clicking on its name in the left nav-bar.

. Add a Flow Ref component at the end of your first flow. In the Flow field, select your other flow.

. Go to your other flow by clicking its name on the left nav-bar. Build it out by adding components.
+
Don't add a trigger, as this flow is triggered by your other flow.
+
Messages will be now processed through all of the components in your first flow and then sent to be processed through all of the components of the second flow.








== Set Metadata for a Flow

You might want to set the expected data types of a flow's input and output, so that elements in a different flow that references it have access to this data.

To do so:

. Click the Options icon image:reference-flow-task-design-center-b93f3.png[] next to each flow name in the left nav-bar and select Edit Types.

. Set the metadata for the different parts of the input and output of the flow, by either selecting existing data types or adding new ones.
