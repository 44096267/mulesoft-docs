= To Set Data Types for a Flow

You can define data types for an entire flow describing its expected input and output. A Flow Ref element that references this flow would then expose this metadata to the rest of the flow it's in. This might be useful while you build your app, particularly if you add Transform to the flow. When you put data types of input and output in place, you can generate DataWeave code for the transformation of matching data using drag-and-drop mapping.

. Click Options image:reference-flow-task-design-center-b93f3.png[] next to the flow name.
