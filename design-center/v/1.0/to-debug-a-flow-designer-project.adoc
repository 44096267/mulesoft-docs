= To Debug Flow Designer Projects

Once your project is running on a sandbox server, it's time to try it out. You can then trigger the event source of each flow to set it into action:

* If you have an HTTP Listener as the event source, you can <<Sending Mock Requests, send mock requests>>.
* If your flow starts with a Poll, you can <<Forcing Redeploy, force redeploy>> of your application.



== Send Mock Requests

This procedure is for when flows in your project are triggered by an HTTP listener connector:


. After creating and deploying your project to sandbox, verify that it's running correctly by looking at its status in the nav bar, it should show a green marker and read *Running*.

. Each application that you develop in Design Center is deployed to a URL that follows the structure *projectName.cloudhub.io*. You can also obtain this URL by clicking on the dropdown menu next to the status marker and selecting *Copy Link*.

. Open a browser and paste the link to your application.

. To that link, append the path to the specific HTTP listener you want to trigger. For example if your project is deployed to `http://myapp.cloudhub.io` and your HTTP connector listens to the Path `/helloworld`, then you should be able to activate that flow by pointing your browser to `http://myapp.cloudhub.io/helloworld`.

[NOTE]
If your flow expects to receive a more complete HTTP request (with a body, headers, etc) you can use tools like postman or curl to send HTTP rquests.

=== Try button

If any of the flows on your project are triggered by a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/poll-reference[Poll] element, then you can trigger that flow manually by clicking on the *Try* button.

== Force Redeploy



If you have a flow with a *Poll* as its event source, you can instantly trigger it into action by forcing the redeployment of your application.

To do so, simply click the `Update` button on the top nav bar.

Otherwise, the flow is triggered regularly at the selected polling interval.

[NOTE]
Note that the poll keeps triggering its flow until you either stop your application or make changes to the project and then *Update* them to the deployed application.


== View Log Data

. Add one or several *Logger* cards to your flow, placing them on the key places where you what to know what data is going through.
. Click each logger card to open it and set the *Message* field to any specific part of the Mule Event that you're interested in.

. Trigger your flow into action. Refer to <<Send Mock Requests>> or <<Force Redeploy>>.
. Expand the *Log* tab at the bottom of the screen to view log data. This should include what the data that the logger components processed, along with messages related to the app deployment and any possible errors.

////
After your flows have been triggered at least once, and actual data has transitioned through them, you can view records of this data as it went through each of the elements in the flow. You can also open an historic view of the messages that came through an element.

[NOTE]
Note that this data is only shown on flow designer when running in development environments. Once you promote your application to a production environment, flow designer can't access data that flows through it.
