= Reference: Designing a RAML-based API

After creating a project for an API spec or API Fragment, you can access the Files dropdown to import a single, or multiple zipped RAML, OAS, or OAS specifications. You can also import files having extensions other than .raml, such as user-examples.json.

You can compress and export all API Designer project files to an external location. In the export files dialog, name the zip file. The Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs overwrites the zip file on subsequent export operations.

You can use a ZIP file that you export from API Designer in the following ways:

* Import the zip file back into Design Center.

* Import the zip file into Anypoint Studio 6.x.

== OAS/RAML Conversion Limitations

OAS 2.0 does not support all RAML 1.0 features.

=== Importing OAS to RAML

When you import OAS 2.0 to RAML 1.0, API Designer defines annotations to prevent the loss of any semantics that do not have RAML counterparts.

=== Exporting RAML to OAS

Before converting a RAML document to OAS 2.0, the converter resolves the following semantics:

* traits

* resource types

* includes

* libraries

During the RAML to OAS 2.0 conversion, the tool is not expected to preserve all semantical data. For more information, see section, “The lost semantics between translations” in the RAML 1.0 → OAS Complete Functional Specification:

`+https://github.com/mulesoft/oas-raml-converter+`

On completion of the conversion, the output is a single OAS document.

== Getting Help

From the dropdown above the RAML Documentation panel, you can link to the RAML Specification and raml.org web site.

== Saving, Renaming, and Deleting a Single File

From the dropdown in the Files panel, select Save All, Rename, or Delete to perform these operations on a single file. The asterisk that indicates an unsaved file in the files panel, disappears. 

// The error indicator in RAML editor about the unsaved file also disappears.

== Importing an OAS 2.0 Specification

Design Center supports the capability to import an OAS 2.0 specification. Before attempting to import the document into API Designer, first validate the OAS document using the validator at the following URL:

`+http://bigstickcarpet.com/swagger-parser+`

Next, import an OAS 2.0 using the dropdown in the Files panel. In Import, select OAS File or OAS Url from the drop-down. Finally, choose the OAS .zip file to upload or in the text entry box, enter the URL. The converted OAS code appears in RAML in the editor panel.

Users have reported problems due to importing OAS documents that the OAS validator validates. RAML validation requirements are stricter than those of the Swagger parser. Also, when you import OAS 2.0 to RAML 1.0, annotations are defined to prevent the loss of any semantics that do not have RAML counterparts. The annotations might not be supported.
