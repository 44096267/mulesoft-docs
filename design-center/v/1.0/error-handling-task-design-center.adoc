= To Handle Errors

You can assign specific parts of a flow to behave differently in case an error occurs when attempting to execute them. Different types of errors can also be assigned to different behaviors.

By placing components inside a Try scope, they're affected by whatever is configured in the scope. The handling of errors can involve custom error messages, corrective actions, email-alerts or anything else that can be done in a flow.



. Add a Try Scope to your flow.

. Click the plus sign on the top section, next to the Try block.

. Add and configure a component from the list, for example a Database Insert operation. You can add as many components as you want following it.

+
These components are executed normally as part of the flow. If an error occurs while executing them, the custom behavior defined in the Try scope is used.

. In the bottom-left section of the scope, open the card and provide a value for the Type field. Select from a list that includes all the errors that can occur on the elements that you added above.

. Click the plus sign that's to the right of this card and add components to handle errors.
+
Any components that you add here are executed when an error of the selected Type occurs while executing any of the components you put in the top section.


. Optional: Add different behaviors for a different error types:
.. Open the card on the bottom-left and click the options icon on its top-right corner image:error-handling-task-design-center-018a5.png[]
.. Select Add Above or Add Below to add a new error type.

+
Note that these are matched in order from top to bottom and only the first to match is executed. If you add one of type All, make sure it's listed last.

.. Configure the newly created card with an error Type and add components to be executed in case this type of error occurs in the scope.
