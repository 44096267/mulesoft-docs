= To Implement Custom Error Handling

If you want to handle errors that may occur on certain components of your flow in a special way, you can wrap these in a Try scope and define an error handling strategy for it.




. Add a Try Scope to your flow.

. Click the plus sign on the top section, next to the Try block.

+
Any components you add here are executed normally. If an error occurs while executing them, the error handler is executed.

. Add      (?)

+
You can add as many components as you want while still in the scope.

. In the bottom section of the scope (the error handler), open the card for the On Error block and provide a value for the Type field. A dropdown menu suggests all the possible errors that could be raised by the elements that are added above.

. Click the plus sign that's to the right of this.
+
Any components that you add here are executed when an error of the selected Type occurs while executing the top section.

. Add  (?)

. Optional: Add a different behavior for a different error type:
.. Open the card corresponding to the On Error block, and click the options icon on its top right corner image:error-handling-task-design-center-018a5.png[]
.. Select Add Above or Add Below to add a new On Error block.

+
Keep in mind that these are evaluated in order from top to bottom and only the first to match is executed.
.. Configure the newly created On Error block with a Type and add components to be executed in case this error occurs.
