= To Handle Errors With Try Scopes (Design Center)


You can put specific parts of a flow that are prone to errors inside a Try Scope. If an attempt to use this part of the flow fails, the scope can catch the errors and apply a fix or an alternative. Different types of errors can be handled differently by the same scope.

When you place a connector inside a Try scope, you can control what happens if an error occurs. That is, you can send an error message, make corrections, or anything else that you can do in a flow.


. Add a Try Scope to your flow.

. Click the plus sign that's next to the Try block.

. Add and configure components, for example a Database Insert operation. You can add as many components as you want following it.

+
These components are used normally as part of the flow. If an error occurs while using them, the Try Scope deals with it.

. In the bottom-left section of the scope, open the card and provide a value for Type. You can either type in a value or select from a list of all the possible errors that can occur on the elements that you added above.

. Click the plus sign that's to the right of this card to add components that the Try scope uses in case of an error.
+

The components that you add here are used when an error of the selected Type occurs while attempting to use any of the components you put in the top section.


== Adding More Error Types


. In an existing Try Scope, open the card and click the Options icon image:error-handling-task-design-center-018a5.png[].
. To add a new error type, select Add Above or Add Below.
+
Error conditions are matched from top to bottom, and only the first match is considered. If you add an error of type `ANY`, make sure that the error is listed last.

. Add an error type to the new card and add the components that should be used in case of an error.
