= To Handle Errors

You can assign specific parts of a flow to behave differently in case an error occurs when attempting to execute them. Different types of errors can also be assigned to different behaviors.

By placing components inside a Try scope, they're affected by whatever is configured in the scope. The handling of errors can involve custom error messages, corrective actions, email-alerts or anything else that can be done in a flow.



. Add a Try Scope to your flow.

. Click the plus sign on the top section, next to the Try block.

. Add and configure a component from the list, for example a Database Insert operation. You can add as many components as you want following it.

+
These components are executed normally as part of the flow. If an error occurs while executing them, the custom behavior defined in the Try scope is used.

. In the bottom-left section of the scope, open the card and provide a value for the Type field. Select from a list that includes all the errors that might occur on the elements that you added above.

. Click the plus sign that's to the right of this card.
+
Any components that you add here are executed when an error of the selected Type occurs while executing the top section.

. Add  (?)

. Optional: Add a different behavior for a different error type:
.. Open the card corresponding to the On Error block, and click the options icon on its top right corner image:error-handling-task-design-center-018a5.png[]
.. Select Add Above or Add Below to add a new On Error block.

+
Keep in mind that these are evaluated in order from top to bottom and only the first to match is executed.
.. Configure the newly created On Error block with a Type and add components to be executed in case this error occurs.
