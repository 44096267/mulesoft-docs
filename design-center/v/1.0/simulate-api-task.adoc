= To Simulate Calling a RAML API

This procedure builds on the Placeholder API example to show you how to test the API. You see the response example from the imported user-example.json file when you preview the /users resource. You see the response example from the reusable example in Exchange that you added as a dependency to the API.

. Select the main RAML spec file placeholder.raml.
. If the RAML Documentation panel does not appear on the right, click image:left-angle-bracket.png[Left Angle Bracket].
. Turn on the Mocking Service.

In your RAML definition, the baseUri changes to a mocking service URI.

. Click the GET tab for the /userbyid resource. Click Try it, accept the default query parameter ID = 3, and click GET.
