= To Export an API from Design Center

You can export an API for use in another tool, or store the API outside Anypoint Platform. For example, you can export an API from Design Center and work on the file using API Workbench on a local computer. You can export a RAML 1.0 (only) API specification to ZIP format. You can import the zip file back into Design Center or into Studio. You can also export the specification, subject to some limitations, to an OAS file in JSON or YAML format. 

. In Design Center, after designing an API specification in RAML 1.0 or opening an API-based specification project based on RAML 1.0, select Files > Export.
