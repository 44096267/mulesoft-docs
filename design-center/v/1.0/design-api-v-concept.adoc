Design Center includes visual editing capabilities for RAML API design. If you know a little about REST APIs, you can specify methods and responses visually. RAML expertise isn't required. Design Center lowers the barrier to API specification languages. 

To define a restful endpoint using a GUI instead of writing RAML code, you populate a GUI with values for resources, including resource types, relationships, and HTTP methods. The GUI then generates the RAML specification. The editor prompts you to describe endpoints and formats the specifications with proper indenting.Â From visual design mode, you can move the API specification to the full-featured code view to enhance or test the design. You can then publish to Exchange.

The resulting RAML output file begins the API life cycle and API design collaboration.

* Root properties
* Data types (payloads)
