= About Visual Design (Beta)

The visual editor is an Anypoint Platform tool for designing an API in RAML. To define a restful endpoint using a GUI instead of writing RAML code, use the visual editor. You populate a GUI with values for resources, including resource types, relationships, and HTTP methods. The GUI then generates the RAML specification.

The editor prompts you to describe endpoints and formats the specifications with proper indenting.Â  The resulting RAML output file begins the API lifecycle and API design collaboration. The visual editor lowers the barrier to API specification languages.
