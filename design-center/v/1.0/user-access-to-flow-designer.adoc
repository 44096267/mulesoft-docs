= User Access to Flow Designer

To have access to Design center, you must have the `Design Center Developer` permission assigned to your user account.


To use the flow designer, your Anypoint organization needs to have at least one CloudHub sandbox link:/access-management/environments[environment] in it. You must have a link:/access-management/roles[CloudHub developer role] in the sandbox environment that your projects are on.

To be able to deploy applications to a production environment, you must also have the link:/access-management/roles[CloudHub developer role] for that environment.
