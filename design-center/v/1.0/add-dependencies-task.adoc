= To Add a Reusable Item to an API

// tech review by Christian, week of mid-April 2017 (kris 4/18/2017)

. In Design Center, select a RAML API Specification project. For example, select the placeholder project.
+
DOC NOTE: IF YOU CAN'T IMPORT AN EXAMPLE ANY LONGER, THIS PROCEDURE IS OK AS IS. IF YOU CAN IMPORT AN EXAMPLE (THERE'S A BUG), CHANGE THIS FRAGMENT TO /USERID INSTEAD OF ANOTHER EXAMPLE.

. Click image:dependencies-icon.png[Get reusable item from exchange].
. In Dependencies, click image:dependencies-plus.png[Plus icon adds a dependency].
. In Consume API Fragment, find the item you want to add to the API, and check that item. For example, continuing with the placeholder API example, find and check myfragment. Click Add 1 Dependency.
. Click image:files-icon.png[Files icon] to exit the dependencies view.
. Expand exchange_modules, drilling down to the myfragment.raml file.
. Click image:myfragment-copy-clipboard.png[Copy path to clipboard].
. In Files, select the API Specification `placeholder.raml` file.
+
The API specification appears in the editor.
+
. Add a reference to the reusable part. For example, indent and add the `include !` followed by a space. Paste the clipboard contents after the explanation point space:
`include ! <clipboard contents>`

DOC QUESTION: IS IT TRUE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ADD MULTIPLE DEPENDENCIES TO THE SAME PROJECT AND SELECTIVELY ADD THEM TO THE RAML. IF SO, I NEED TO INCLUDE ADDING THE /USERBYID RESOURCE TO THIS PROCEDURE.
