= About Designing a RAML-based API

// tech review by Christian, week of mid-April 2017 (kris 4/18/2017)

In Design Center, you can create, simulate, and publish reusable projects of type API specification or API fragment. RAML.org defines documents of these types something like this:

* API specification
+
A RAML API definition document that begins with the text `#%RAML` followed by a single space and the version number `1.0`. 
+
* API fragment
+ 
A document, such as a data type, that begins with the RAML version, just like a RAML specification, but includes a fragment identifier.

The RAML fragment does not completely define a REST API as a RAML specification does.

You publish an API fragment in Exchange and add it to your specification, and others, as a dependency. You can change the fragment outside the specification and update the fragment version in the specification.

To create and publish an API specification or fragment, you need to have the permissions covered in "User Access to Design Center." 

== OAS Support

Design Center supports the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) and the Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0, also known as Swagger. When you import an OAS specification, OAS code is converted to RAML. You can edit the resulting RAML code in the RAML editor.
