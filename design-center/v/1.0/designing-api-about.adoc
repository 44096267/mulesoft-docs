= About Designing a RAML-based API

// tech review by Christian, week of mid-April 2017 (kris 4/18/2017)

In Design Center, if you have the permissions covered in "User Access to Design Center," you can create, simulate, and publish reusable projects of type API specification or API fragment. RAML.org defines documents that correspond to these types something like this:

* API specification
+
A RAML API definition document that begins with the text #%RAML followed by a single space followed by the text 1.0. 
+
* API fragment
+ 
A document, such as a data type, that begins similarly to an API specification, having a RAML version comment and a fragment identifier, but is not in itself a RAML API definition document. 

Design Center supports the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) and the Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0, also known as Swagger. When you import an OAS specification, OAS code is converted to RAML. You can edit the resulting RAML code in the RAML editor.
