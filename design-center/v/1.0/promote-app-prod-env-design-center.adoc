= To Promote an App to an Environment (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

When your app is ready to publish, you can promote it to any environment in your Anypoint organization. For example, a staging database for apps can live in the staging environment, while the production database lives in the production environment. This eliminates the need to add property placeholders.

Promoting an app to a selected environment might give your app more exposure than you think, so determine the consequences of each promotion. 


. Click the *Promote Application* button on the top navbar image:deploying-your-project-a675b.png[]

. Select a name for running your application and the CloudHub environment to promote the application.

. Set up the connector configurations of your project for this new environment.

Connector configuration fields are the same from one environment to another. 

. After promoting, you can go to Runtime Manager to manage the application.
