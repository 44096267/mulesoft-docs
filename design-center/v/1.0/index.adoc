= About Design Center
:keywords: mozart

The Design Center is a web-based editor that forms part of the Anypoint Platform. To access this tool, you need to have an Anypoint Platform account with permissions that allow you to create and manage APIs and/or applications.

Through the Design Center, you can build applications and API definitions that enable connectivity throughout your application network. By combining and configuring existing components, you can compose solutions without needing to understand the underlying architecture and technical concepts of each of these.


== Create Applications

You can build fully functional Mule applications. These can then be deployed to run in the cloud, where they can perform a wide variety of tasks that may involve interfacing with other services and databases, data conversion, etc. These tasks may be carried out on demand or by schedule, depending on how you build your applications.

For example, you can create an application that listens for HTTP requests on a given address, validates that requests include the necessary credentials, queries a user database based on these credentials, then transforms output data from the database into JSON objects, and sends this data back to requestors.




== Create API Definitions

You can create API definition files, which describe the various interactions that are possible through an API. These API definition files can then be leveraged by the Anypoint Platform to ease adoption, provide management capabilities, and generate interactive documentation.

These definition files can also be leveraged by Anypoint Studio to speed up the application development process in a way that enforces that the end result fits usage expectations.

API definitions are described in RAML. This light-weight YAML-like language lets you specify the API's resources, methods, properties and more, together with samples and schemas.

== Create API Fragments

You can also create API fragments, which consist of reusable sections of an API definition file that can be referenced by API definitions.
