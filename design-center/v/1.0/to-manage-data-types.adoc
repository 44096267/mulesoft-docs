= To Handle Data Types
:keywords: mozart


The _type_ of your data refers to its *metadata*, this is the representation of the structure of data, regardless of its format.

For example, the metadata of a message may define that the 'user' element has two child elements: 'name' and 'address'; it doesn't matter if the message is in JSON or XML format, the structure is beyond that.

When this information is available to another card, it is interpreted as the expected input or output, depending on where each are placed relative to each other on the flow.

[TIP]
Many elements you can use in your projects expose the types of their input and output data to the rest of the flow. In such cases, there's no need to provide this information manually. For example, when a connector is configured to carry out a specific operation, its output structure is known to Design Center.




== Assign Existing Data Types

Almost all cards include an *Input* and *Output* tab. In these tabs you can describe the types of the data that both enters and leaves the component, with specifics about each element in the Mule Event: the payload, its properties and variables.

If the flow has had any activity, you can also view the actual data that has transitioned through the component.

. Open a card and select the *Input* or *Output* tab on the top margin:

. On the dropdown menu next to *Show*, pick the part of the Mule event you want to view: Payload, Attributes or any existng Variables.

. On the dropdown menu next to *Data Types*, select a data type that you want to assign to this part of the Mule event out of the types you've already designed. You can also define a new type.




== Create a Custom Data Type

=== Access the Custom Data Type Screen

You can reach the custom data type screen in the following ways:


* Open a card and select its *Input* or *Output* tab, select the part of the Mule event you want your type to define, then click the *Add* button next to the *Data Type* dropdown.

* Open a *Transform card*, and click *Customize Data Type* on the element you want to define.

* On the left sidebar, click the plus sign at the very top and then select *New Type*

=== Define a Custom Type

. Access the custom data type screen.
. Give your type a name.
. Select the *Format* of your type from the dropdown.
+
[NOTE]
For the beta release of Design Center, only JSON, XML, CSV and Java object formats are supported for providing metadata.

. Define your custom type by either providing an *example* or a *schema*, select one of these two options.

+
[NOTE]
Some formats only allow you to provide a schema. To provide a Schema for a CSV or Java format, you must provide the schema as a link:raml.org[RAML] file.

. Paste a sample or schema in the input box

. The preview section on the right displays the resulting structure tree.

. When you're happy with your new data type, simply click *Save*. Once defined, the type can be assigned anywhere in your project.


== Set Data Types for the Transform Card

To use the drag and drop UI of the link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-transform-data[Transform Card], your flow must have metadata for both the input and the output of this component, that way it knows what's available and where it can be mapped to.

There are several ways you can provide this required metadata:

* Make sure that other elements in the flow are fully configured. For example, a connector can't expose its output structure until a given operation is chosen, as its output might differ depending on this.
* You can manually assign a data type to the previous component in the flow via its Input and Output tabs. This information is propagated forward and transformed as it transitions through other components.
* You can manually define the input and output of the Transform component. For this you can either:
** Click the Customize Data Type icon image:to-manage-data-types-69ae0.png[] below either the input pane or the output pane.
** On the input pane, expand the element you want to define and click its *Customize data type* link.
** On the output pane, open the dropdown menu next to the *Output* label, and select *Edit Current Data Type*.
** On the output pane, click the *Customize Data Type* link in the notification that warns you about missing input metadata.

Note that for the input, you can define the data types for all parts of the Mule event. For the output, on the other hand (as the transformation has one single output) you can only define one part. By default, this is the payload. If you want to output to a different part of the mule event:

* Click the dropdown menu next to the *Output* label
* Select *Add Transformation*.
* Pick an attribute or variable to output to.

== Add an API Definition File

The HTTP Request Connector doesn't expose any information by default, but you can provide the connector a link:raml.org[RAML] API definition file, which includes information about required inputs and expected outputs.

[NOTE]
Note that this feature is only available with HTTP Request Connectors, not with HTTP Listener Connectors (the kind that can serve as triggers to a flow) nor any other type of connector.

To do so:

. Add a new HTTP Request Connector and edit its link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-connector-configurations[Connector Configurations]
+

. Pick the *API Specification* tab

+
image:to-define-data-types-24906.png[]

. Add a URL to reference to an API definition file
+
[NOTE]
Currently, you can only reference API definition files that are hosted on the web. Future releases will allow you to upload your own file.
