= To Handle Data Types
:keywords: mozart

== Overview

The _type_ of your data refers to its *metadata*, this is the representation of the structure of data, regardless of its format.

For example, the metadata of a message may define that the 'user' element has two child elements: 'name' and 'address'; it doesn't matter if the message is of type JSON or XML, the structure is beyond that.

When this information is available to another card, it is interpreted as the expected input or the required output, depending on where each are placed relative to each other on the flow.

There are many ways in which the flow designer can leverage information about the types of data that transition through your flows, see link:/design-center/v/1.0/about-data-types[About Data Types] to learn how it's used. This document covers how to provide that information to flow designer.

Many elements you can use in your projects expose the types of their input and output data to the rest of the flow. In such cases, there's no need to provide this information manually. For example, when a connector is configured to carry out a specific operation, its output structure is known to flow designer.



== The Data Types Tab

Almost all cards include a *Data Types Tab*. This tab lets you describe the types of the data that both enters and leaves the component, with specifics about each element in the Mule Event: the payload, its properties and variables.

. Open a card and select the *Data Types* tab on the left margin:

. Set up the parts o the input and output that you need
.. *Payload or Attributes*: either select one of the data types you've already defined in your project from the dropdown, or click *New* to create a <<Custom Data Types, custom data type>>.
.. *Variables*: click *Add*. Then name your new variable and either select one of the data types you've already defined in your project from the dropdown, or click *New* to create a <<Custom Data Types, custom data type>>.

+
You can then keep clicking *Add* to add as many variables as you want.

== API Definition Files

The HTTP Request Connector doesn't expose any information by default, but you can provide the connector a link:raml.org[RAML] API definition file, which includes information about required inputs and expected outputs.

[NOTE]
Note that this feature is only available with HTTP Request Connectors, not with HTTP Listener Connectors (the kind that can serve as triggers to a flow) nor any other type of connector.

To do so:

. Add a new HTTP Request Connector and edit its link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-global-configurations[Global Configurations]
+

. Pick the *API Specification* tab

+

. Add a URL to reference to an API definition file
+
[NOTE]
Currently, you can only reference API definition files that are hosted on the web. Future releases will allow you to upload your own file.


== Custom Data Types

You can reach the *New Type* menu from either the *Data Type tab* in a connector, or from the *Transform card*.

. Give your type a name.
. Define the *Format* of your type from the dropdown.
+
[NOTE]
For the beta release of Design Center, only JSON, XML, CSV and Java object formats are supported for providing metadata.

. You can define your custom type by providing an example or a schema, select one of the two options.

+
[NOTE]
Some formats only allow you to provide a schema. To provide a Schema for a CSV or Java format, you must provide the schema as a link:raml.org[RAML] file.

. Paste a sample or schema in the input box

. The preview section on the right displays the resulting tree.

. When you're happy with your new data type, simply click *Save*. Once defined, the type is made available to use anywhere in your project.


== Data Types in the Transform Card

To use the drag and drop UI of the link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-transform-data[Transform Card], your flow must have metadata for both the input and the output of this component, that way it knows what's available and where it can be mapped to.

There are several ways you can provide this required metadata:

* Make sure that other elements in the flow are fully configured. For example, a connector can't expose its output structure until a given operation is chosen, as its output might differ depending on this.
* You can manually define the output of a previous component in the flow via its <<Data Types tab>>. This information is propagated forward and transformed as it transitions through other components.

* You can manually define the input and output of the Transform component by clicking on the *Define Data Type* link that appears in the notification that warns you about missing input metadata, or by opening the dropdown menu next to the *Output* label, and selecting *Edit Current Data Type*.

Note that for the input, you can define data type separately for the message payload, for its attributes and for each of the variables.

By default, the transformation is set to output a new message payload, but you can change this by selecting the dropdown menu next to the *Output* label and selecting *Add Transformation*. You can then pick an attribute or variable to output to.
