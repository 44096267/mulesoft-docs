= Test an Enanced API Using MUnit
:keywords: tests, qa, quality assurance, verify, functional testing, unit testing, stress testing

== Overview

Following the example developed in link:/api-quick-start/v/latest/enhance-an-api-using-anypoint-studio[the previous article], this tutorial focuses on giving you an easy walkthrough to develop a *unit test* for said application.

A _unit test_ consists of verifying that a single _unit of code_ works as expected. +
In this particular example, we focus on verifying the statuses and payloads returned by your APIKit router configuration following your `file.raml` specs. +
The purpose of running unit tests is making sure that the core functions of your application behave as you intend them to behave and return the values that you expect them to return. +
Later on, you can choose to automate each test to run before you deploy the application so you can make sure that all core functionalities in your project comply with your design.

To do this, we employ link:/munit/v/1.2.0/index[MUnit], a _Mule application testing framework_ that allows you to build automated tests for your integrations and APIs. +
For this example, we are using a few components to write the test. +
Keep in mind that MUnit provides a full suite of integration and unit test capabilities. To learn more about its components and how to integrate MUnit with your continuous deployment environment, check the link:/munit/v/1.2.0/index[MUnit documentation].


== Enhance Your Existing Test

This tutorials assumes that you link:/api-quick-start/import-an-api-into-anypoint-studio#generate-an-munit-test-suite-based-on-a-raml[generated an automatic MUnit test] when you imported your API into Anypoint Studio.

Since now your application consumes the data from a web service, the payloads that this test asserts change to match the results served by the Web Service.

Run the t-shirt application from Studio and use the APIKit console to mock a GET request to products/. Note that it returns the following JSON response:

[source,json,linenums]
----
[
  {
    "productCode": [
      "4102",
      "1412",
      "5656",
      "5657",
      "1411"
    ],
    "size": [
      "L",
      "L",
      "S",
      "M",
      "M"
    ],
    "description": [
      "Prueba",
      "Foo",
      "Bar",
      "Prueba2",
      "Awesome Tshirt"
    ],
    "count": [
      "2",
      "9",
      "2",
      "3",
      "5"
    ]
  }
]
----

Save this raw JSON response as `getTestSample.json` in your classpath under */src/test/resources*:

In your automatically generated _test suite_, locate the `get:/products:t-shirt-config-200-application/json-FlowTest` test and double click in the link:/munit/v/1.2.0/assertion-message-processor#assert-equals[Assert Equals Message Processor] and replace your current expected value to a MEL expression that loads the expected response from a file located in your _classpath_:

[source,MEL,linenums]
----
#[getResource('getTestSample.json').asString()]
----


[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....
image:assert-payload-equals-update-expected-payload.png[assert-payload-equals-update-expected-payload]
....
[tab,title="XML or Standalone Editor"]
....
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<munit:assert-on-equals message="The response payload is not correct!" expectedValue="#[getResource('getTestSample.json').asString()]" actualValue="#[paylaod]" doc:name="Assert Equals"/>
----
....
------

[IMPORTANT]
--
The file referenced in the `getResource()` expression needs to be in your classpath. You can't invoke external files using this expression.
--

Do the same with the _Assert Equals Message Processor_ in your `get:/orders/status:t-shirt-config-200-application/json-FlowTest` flow. +
. Simulate an empty *POST* request with the query parameters `email` and `orderId` using the APIKit console rendered when you run your application
. Save the generated raw response in your classpath under */src/test/resources* (name it `postTestSample.json`)
. Use the same MEL expression to assert the payload against the expected one: `#[getResource('postTestSample.json').asString()]`.
