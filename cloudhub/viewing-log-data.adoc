= Viewing Log Data
:keywords: cloudhub, logging, log, log events, log data, search

CloudHub provides access to log data so that you can monitor your application and diagnose any potential issues. CloudHub stores log data in Universal Time (UTC); however, the console displays the log using your computer's local time zone. CloudHub saves 100,000 log events per application. Logs that exceed the limit are truncated every 24 hours to 100,000 events by discarding the oldest events past the limit. Individual log entries are limited to a maximum length of 100K characters; longer log entries are truncated to the limit.

== Pausing and Clearing a Log

To pause the log so that entries are temporarily stopped from writing, click *Live view* and click *Pause*. While the log is paused, a green *Resume* button appears. Click *Resume* to enable more content to be written.

In *Live view*, you can click the *Clear* button to clear the viewing window, so you only see the latest logs generated by the application, which is useful for debugging. The log contents are not deleted, so if you switch views to Archive and back to Live view, the full contents of the log reappear. You can also refresh your browser to see the full log.

== Log Search Filters

The *Live view* setting provides a live, continually updated stream of current log data from all an application's workers.

To search:

. From the *Applications* menu, click an application to view its details menu, and click *Manage Application*.
. Click *Settings* > *Logs*.
. Click *Archive* view and *Advanced* to set search filters to limit the log display to entries listed by date and time, or by priority:

=== Search by Date and Time

The *Date & time* filter lets you specify a date range to search the log. Possible values are:

* Last hour
* Last 24hrs
* Last week
* Last month

=== Search by Message Priority

The Priority filter lets you view specific events in the log. You can also specify different priorities by typing __priority:<type>__ in the search box, as shown in the Command column in the table.

Possible values are:

[width="90",cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description |Command
|All Priorities |List all messages |--
|ERROR |List only error messages, such when an exception occurs. |priority:ERROR
|FATAL |List only fatal messages for when an application fails |priority:FATAL
|INFO |List informative messages |priority:INFO
|SYSTEM |List messages about application and worker startup |priority:SYSTEM
|CONSOLE |List message about console events such as setting the objectstore |priority:CONSOLE
|WARN |List warning messages |priority:WARN
|DEBUG |List debugging messages |priority:DEBUG
|===

=== Wildcard Searching

You can also filter log data by entering search terms into the search box at the top of the log page that match results in the log message. You can search for any exact term in the log message as well as a few common quantifiers for wildcard searching:

[width="10",cols="10,90"]
|===
|? |The question mark matches zero or one of the preceding element.
|* |The asterisk matches zero or more of the preceding element.
|===

== Log Page Controls

CloudHub provides page controls to help you move through the logs when you view historical data. The most recent logs are on page one. The data gets older as you step through the higher pages. 

You can configure the number of results that display on each page by clicking *Archive* and the down-arrow next to the number of entries:

Click *FIRST*, *LAST*, or the number of entries to view per page, *10*, *25*, or *50*.

== Downloading Log Data

Click *Archive* and click *Download* to save a copy of the current log view to your computer:

You are prompted for a save location. You can download a maximum of 10,000 lines of log data with a single save. However, using repeated views with contiguous time windows as search criteria, the entire log may be downloaded.
