= Upgrading to Tcat Server 6 R3

If you have Tcat Server 6.2.1 installed, the new installer will retain all paired servers, new web applications, user roles, server profiles, and environment variables you have saved.

If you are using an earlier version of Tcat Server, you need to follow the upgrade path to 6.2.1 first. (link to Upgrading to Tcat Server 6 R2 P1)
