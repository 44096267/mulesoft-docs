= To Sync an API

When you update a RAML file from Anypoint Studio, you can synchronize those changes to your API version hosted in Anypoint Platform. Assuming you created the placeholder API described in the previous sections, make some small change to the API. Navigate to your `placeholder.raml` file in the Package Explorer, and double-click to open the file in your link:/apikit/apikit-using#define-the-raml-or-wsdl-in-studio[RAML Editor]. For example, edit the RAML to change a description slightly.

== Synchronize your Updated RAML File With Anypoint Platform

Notice that after making the change, the API Sync view becomes available for uploading changes through the _Upload_ button:

You can select your `raml` file and click the _Upload_ button to submit your chances to Anypoint Platform.

To learn more about this in detail, check our link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/api-sync-reference[API sync reference page]. +
You can also navigate to your API Designer to check how the updates were pushed.
