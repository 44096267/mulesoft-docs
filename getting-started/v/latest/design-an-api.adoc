= To Design an API
:keywords: api, define, creator, create, raml


This procedure covers one way to create a RAML-based API in Anypoint Platform. You can create a modern RAML-based API from an existing SOAP-based API or start with just an idea and design the API from start to finish using RAML. In this procedure, you design the API from start to finish.

== Prerequisites

To create an API in Anypoint Platform, you need an account and permissions. If you do not have an account, you can sign up for a free account in the cloud. 

`+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signin+`

If you set up your account in the cloud, you have the permissions to create an API. If you're using an organization's account, you might not have these permissioons. You need API Creators and/or Organization Administrator access. To determine your access level, after logging into Anypoint Platform, click Access Management.

In the Access Management screen, click Roles, and look for API Creators or Organization Administrator. If one or both of these roles are visible in the Roles listing, you can proceed. If you cannot see these roles, contact your site administrator before proceeding with this procedure.

== Create an API Definition and Build a RAML File

An API definition is the name of an API and its version that you specify in the API Manager.
