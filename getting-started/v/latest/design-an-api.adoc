= To Design an API
:keywords: api, define, creator, create, raml


This procedure covers one way to create a RAML-based API in Anypoint Platform. You can create a modern RAML-based API from an existing SOAP-based API or start with just an idea and design the API from start to finish using RAML. In this procedure, you design the API from start to finish.

== Prerequisites

To create an API in Anypoint Platform, you need the following:

* If you do not have an account, click Sign Up:
+
`+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signin+`
+
* API Creators and/or Organization Administrator Access. 

After you log into Anypoint Platform, click Access Management.

You can press Escape to open or close the left navigation bar in Anypoint Platform.

In the Access Management screen, click Roles and look for API Creators or Organization Administrator. If one or both of these roles are visible in the Roles listing, you can proceed. If you cannot see these roles, contact your site administrator before proceeding with this procedure.

== Create an API Definition and Build a RAML File

An API definition is the name of an API and its version that you specify in the API Manager.
