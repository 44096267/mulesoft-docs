= To View the RAML of an API

// Does not work. Maybe I misunderstood and the feature isn't available.

After you deploy an API, you configure an HTTP request to view the RAML specification of the API in API Console, assuming the API isn't blocked by a policy. This procedure assuming you are running an APIkit API in Studio and are using the mocking service to simulate the API as described in "To Simulate API Calls Using API Console."

. Click Try It in API Console to expose the Headers tab.
. In Request URL, add `/?raml` to the API Console URL: `<baseURL>/console/?raml` 
+
For example, http://0.0.0.0:8081/console/?raml/
+
. Click Add Custom Header, and in Header Name, select the Accept key from the list that appears.
. In the Header Value, type the *application/raml+yaml*.

. Send the request.

The RAML code for the API appears in the Body section.
