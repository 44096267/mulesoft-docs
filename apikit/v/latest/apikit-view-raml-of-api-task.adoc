= To View the RAML of an API

You can view the RAML of a running API, assuming the API isnâ€™t blocked by a policy. Use a URL that has the following syntax:

* RAML 1.0: `{scheme}://{host}:{port}/{console path}/{api resources folder}{optional resource path}/?raml`
* RAML 0.8: `{scheme}://{host}:{port}/{api resources folder}{optional resource path}/?raml`
+
For a 0.8 RAML only, you need to use the following header and a GET method:
+
`Accept: application/raml+yaml`

Examples of the Root RAML:

* RAML 1.0: http://localhost:8081/console/api/?raml
* RAML 0.8: http://localhost:8081/api/?raml 

To view the RAML, enter the URL on the command line using `curl`, or use a client, such as Postman.
