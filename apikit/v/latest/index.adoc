= APIkit Overview

APIkit 4.0 Beta is a toolkit that enables developers to be extremely productive in creating well-designed REST APIs. 
By using a REST API designed in RAML, APIKit automatically creates backend flows for RESTful calls. 

For validation of RAML-based API, APIkit sets up the API Console V4 and also let developers enforce best practices, by using the error handler, now unified with Mule.

For RAML development, MuleSoft recommends using Design Center, but you can also build the RAML using Studio RAML Editor. 
Anypoint Studio allows to import the RAML and to create an APIkit project from scratch or add it to an existing project.
