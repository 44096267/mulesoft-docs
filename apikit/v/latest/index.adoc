= APIkit Overview

APIkit 4.0 Beta enables developers to easily design and implement RESTful APIs with Mule. It automatically creates Mule flows for APIs that are documented in RAML and enables them to interact with the API console. APIkit 4 also leverages Mule 4 features by letting API developers tie into the new Mule 4 error handling. For RAML development, MuleSoft recommends using Design Center, but you can also build the RAML using Studio RAML Editor.
