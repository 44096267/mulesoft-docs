= APIkit Overview

APIkit 4.0 Beta simplifies the design and implementation of Mule RESTful APIs. You create Mule flows for a RAML-based API automatically. You can simulate calls to the generated API using API Console. APIkit 4.0 also supports Mule Runtime 4.0 features, such as error handling.  For RAML development, MuleSoft recommends using Design Center. You can also use the RAML Editor in Studio.
