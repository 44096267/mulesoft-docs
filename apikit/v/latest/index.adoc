= APIkit Overview

If you create REST APIs, APIkit 4.0 Beta is a toolkit that can improve your productivity and help ensure well-designed REST APIs. 
By using a REST API designed in RAML, APIKit automatically creates backend flows for RESTful calls. 

For validation of a RAML-based API, APIkit sets up the API Console V4 and also enforces best practices by using the error handler unified with Mule 4.

For RAML development, MuleSoft recommends using Design Center, but you can also build the RAML using the Studio RAML Editor. You can import the RAML to create an APIkit project from scratch or add it to an existing project.
