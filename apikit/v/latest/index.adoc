= APIkit Overview

APIkit 4.0 Beta is a tool that facilitates REST development. First, you develop APIs based on the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML). For RAML development, MuleSoft recommends using Design Center. Alternatively, you can build the RAML inside Studio using the built-in text editor or outside Studio use any text editor. 

Next, you bring the RAML into Anypoint Studio to create an APIkit project. Creation of the project includes error handling and generates flows for RESTful calls. 

Finally, in a browser, you link to APIkit Console to simulate calls to the API. You can build out the framework of the design by adding to the flows generated by APIkit. For example, you can add web services, document, and test the API. You can apply policies to the API in Anypoint Platform.
