= APIkit Overview

APIkit 4.0 Beta is a tool that facilitates REST development. You develop APIs based on the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML). For RAML development, MuleSoft recommends using Design Center, but you can build the RAML using any text editor. You import the RAML into Anypoint Studio to create an APIkit project or add RAML to an existing project. APIkit auto-generates error handling and Mule flows based on the RAML. 

In a browser, you link to APIkit Console to simulate calls to the API. To implement the API, you build out the framework of the design in Studio.
