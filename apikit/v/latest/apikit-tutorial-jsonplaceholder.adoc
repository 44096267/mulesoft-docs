= Consuming a Web Service
:keywords: api, raml, json

Using APIkit and Anypoint Studio, you can simulate, implement, and deploy an RAML API that connects web service. For example purposes, this procedure uses the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder at `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`.  In this procedure, you download a RAML API specification and create an APIkit project in Studio to simulate, implement, and deploy the interface. The JSONPlaceholder service provides JSON user information. The RESTful API consumes the JSON resource and filters user information.

. Download the ZIP file containing the RAML API Specification and JSON example code from the "Download" section at the end of this topic. Unzip the file.
. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project. In Project Settings, set the following options:
* Project Name: any name, for example, *myproject*
* Add APIkit components: Check this option.
* Select a RAML specification from Design Center or the file system.

+
For example, select Browse Files, browse to and select the api.raml that you downloaded.
+
* Click Finish.
+
Studio launches the new project and generates a Main flow with an HTTP Listener, an APIkit Router, and error handling. Backend flows for consuming information from the `users` and `usersbyid` resources also appear.

The RAML file you imported resides `src/main/api`.

. Click Run As > Mule Application.

The application deploys and you can now simulate calling the API using APIkit Console.
