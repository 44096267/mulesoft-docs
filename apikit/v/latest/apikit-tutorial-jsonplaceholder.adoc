= Consuming a REST Service
:keywords: api, raml, json

This procedure uses the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder at `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+` for example purposes.  The JSONPlaceholder service provides user information in JSON format. You download a RAML API specification and create an APIkit project in Studio based on the RAML. You deploy and simulate calls to the API using API Console. The RESTful API consumes the JSON resource and filters user information.

. From the "Download" section at the end of this topic, download the ZIP file containing the RAML API specification and JSON example code. Unzip the file.
. In Studio, click File > New > Mule Project. In Project Settings, set the following options:
* Project Name: Type any name, for example, *myproject*.
* Add APIkit components: Check this option.
* Select a RAML specification from Design Center or the file system. For example, select Browse Files, browse to and select the `api.raml` that you downloaded.

When you finish, Studio launches the new project and generates a Main flow with an HTTP Listener, an APIkit Router, and error handling. Backend flows for consuming information from the `users` and `usersbyid` resources appear.

The RAML file you imported appears in `src/main/api`.

The application deploys and you can now simulate calling the API using APIkit Console.
