= To Validate Headers and Query Parameters

This procedure assumes that you have generated Mule flows using APIkit in Studio. You configure APIkit Router to validate, or not, headers and query parameters. By default validations are disabled.

. In Studio, select APIkit Router.

+
. Check Query Parameters Strict Validations to limit parameters to those defined in the RAML.
. Check Headers Strict Validations to limit headers as follows:
+
* Allow only headers defined in the RAML
* No header duplication. 
+
If a request has more than one header ID that is not of the array type, it is disallowed.
. Reverse the procedure in steps 3 and 4 to inhibit the respective validation, or check Disable Validations to inhibit both validations.
