= Using APIkit
:keywords: apikit, rest, console, load balancer

APIkit 3.8.1 supports RAML 1.0. Earlier versions of APIkit support earlier versions of RAML on API Gateway Runtime or Mule runtime version 3.5.0 or later, as described in the link:/release-notes/apikit-release-notes[release notes]. 

APIkit projects function with on-premises and CloudHub runtimes.

To get started using APIkit in Studio, do one of the following:

* Import a RAML or WSDL file from one of the following sources:
** File system
** Anypoint Platform
** A network or internet location
+
Refer to the URL of a RAML or WSDL file when you create a new project.
+
* Create the RAML file within an existing Studio project.
+
Using this sequence of development is called a link:/apikit/apikit-using#backend-first-design-process[backend-first design].

The link:/apikit/apikit-tutorial[REST tutorial] and link:/apikit/apikit-for-soap[SOAP tutorial] cover importing an API from the file system to Studio when you create a new project. When you import an API from Anypoint Platform, APIkit includes any RAML dependencies in the Studio project. You can then keep the API in both locations link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/api-sync-reference[in sync] by pushing or pulling changes from one to the other.

APIkit generates the following things when you import or reference a RAML or WSDL that declares a baseURI or namespace, respectively:

* A main flow with an HTTP Listener
+
After importation, you can replace the HTTP Listener with a Jetty endpoint.
+
* An APIkit Router or SOAP Router, respectively
* A RAML-based exception strategy mapping or a SOAP fault response template, respectively:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="api-main">
    <http:listener config-ref="api-httpListenerConfig" path="" doc:name="HTTP"/>
    <apikit:router config-ref="api-config" doc:name="APIkit Router"/>
    <exception-strategy ref="api-apiKitGlobalExceptionMapping" doc:name="Reference Exception Strategy"/>
</flow>
----

Included in the project are backend flows containing REST resource-action mappings or SOAP message templates. APIkit Console is included when you import a RAML, but not a WSDL. You need to use a SOAP testing tool, such as SoapUI. APIkit Console is similar to link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#api-console[API Console] for simulating calls to the API.

After simulating calls to a RAML-based API using APIkit Console, and improving or changing behavior, you alter the backend flows to act upon real resources with real data.

== Changing APIkit Elements

In a RAML-based API, if you change or add exception strategies, you need to adjust link:/apikit/apikit-using#generate-backend-flows-and-reference-exception-strategies[references to exception strategies].

Under the following conditions, you need to link:/apikit/apikit-using#map-resources-to-actions[customize the mapping] of RAML resources and actions:

* You generated backend flows as part of the backend-first design process.
* You renamed a backend flow.

In a SOAP-based API, if you change the WSDL, regenerate backend flows. Click *Mule* > *Generate SOAP Flows*.

== Backend-First Design Process

You can add APIkit components to an existing design, for example a legacy project that you want to modernize using RAML and APIkit. In this case, you use the backend-first design process to create the RAML or WSDL code within Studio, you need to perform a number of tasks to generate APIkit components:

*RAML-based API*

* Define the RAML.
* Create a main flow, or use an existing one, that includes an *HTTP Listener* and *APIkit Router*.
* Create resource-action mappings.
* link:/apikit/apikit-using#generating-backend-flows[Generate backend flows].
* Add a link:/apikit/apikit-using#generate-backend-flows-and-reference-exception-strategies[reference to exception strategies] in the main flow.
* Add an *APIkit Console* component.
+
APIkit Console functionality depends on backend flows.

*WSDL-based API*

* Define the WSDL within Studio.
* Create a main flow, or use an existing one, that includes an *HTTP Listener* and *SOAP Router*.
* link:/apikit/apikit-using#generating-backend-flows[Generate backend flows].
* Using DataWeave, provide XML responses to the SOAP faults.

The generated backend flows contain the core logic of the API, the REST resource-action pairing or SOAP message templates for handling faults.

=== Define the RAML or WSDL in Studio

The following procedure describes how to define a RAML-based API in Studio. Similar steps apply to defining a WSDL-based API.

. In the *Package Explorer*, right-click the project name, then select *New* > *RAML API Definition*.
+
The *New RAML API Definition* dialog appears.
+
. Accept the default location `src/main/api` and enter a name in *File Name*.
. Click *Finish*.
+
Studio creates and opens a new file in the `src/main/api` folder in your project.
+
image:new_raml.png[new_raml]
+
. Add the link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md[RAML].

Alternatively, you can use any text editor to create the API definition, and then drag the file into the `src/main/api` folder of the Studio project.

==== Work with the Built-In RAML Editor

Within the RAML Editor, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

* CTRL +spacebar to auto-complete RAML entries
* Command+O (CTRL+O in Windows) to open an Outline View of the RAML Editor
+
Arranged as a simplified tree-structure, you can scan the top-level contents of the API. 
+
image:apikit_outlineView.png[apikit_outlineView]

Use the minus or plus icon next to the line number in the RAML Editor to expand or collapse code contained within a section of the document.

image:apikit_hover.png[apikit_hover]

To change the color scheme of the RAML Editor in Studio.

. From the *Anypoint Studio* menu, select *Preferences*. 
. Expand *RAML Editor Preferences*, then select *Color Theme*.
. Select a color theme and click *OK*.

==== Generate an !include

In RAML-based API designs, you can generate link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/#includes[!includes] as follows: 

. In the RAML file, select the content to include.
. Right-click and select **RAML API Editor  > Generate include from "<your_content>" value**.
+
. Use the wizard to register a file name for the `!include`, then click *Finish*.
+
Studio saves the `!include` file in your Studio project and automatically inserts the include into your RAML API Definition.

=== Create a Main Flow

Within the APIkit project, build a flow. Drag the following components from the Mule palette:

* An HTTP (or Jetty) Listener
* An APIkit Router or a SOAP Router

image::apikit-using-ea7ad.png[apikit-using-ea7ad]

=== Generate REST Backend Flows and Reference Exception Strategies

When you create a RAML or WSDL from within Studio, you have the option of generating backend flows, or not. Exception strategies are generated for a RAML-based API. You need to reference these strategies from the main flow. This procedure assumes you have already created a main flow.

To generate backend flows, including reference exception strategies: 

. In the *Package Explorer*, right-click the project name.
. Select *Mule* > *Generate Flows from RAML*
+
The backend flows appear below the main flow.
+
image::apikit-tutorial-ce60c.png[]
+
. Expand the *Error handling* section in the main flow.
. Drag a *Reference Exception Strategy* component from the Mule palette to the Error handling section.
. On the Configuration.xml tab, add link:/apikit/apikit-basic-anatomy#raml-based-exception-strategy-mappings[exception strategy mappings] to the project right after the last `</flow>` tag.

=== Generate SOAP Backend Flows

To generate backend flows for a SOAP-based API, right click the project name. Select *Mule* > *Generate Flows from WSDL*

=== Map RAML Resources to Actions

As part of the backend-first design process, you map RAML resources to actions as shown in the following procedure. This procedure assumes you have generated backend flows and referenced exception strategies.

To map resources to actions:

. Click the APIkit Router to open the *Properties Editor*. In *Router configuration*, click image:Add-16x16.png[Add-16x16].
+
The *Global Element Properties* wizard appears.
+
image::apikit-using-9bea1.png[apikit-using-9bea1]
+
. Browse to the RAML file you created within Studio.
. In Mappings, click image:Add-16x16.png[Add-16x16] to create a new mapping.
+
The *New Mapping* dialog appears.
. Use the drop-down to map the resources to actions.
+
* In the Resource drop-down, select `/sales`.
+
* In the Action drop-down, select `Post`.
+
* In the Flow drop-down, select the flow that contains the post action:
+
`post:/sales:applicaiton/json:Router`
+
Click *OK*.
+
image::apikit-using-ab251.png[apikit-using-ab251]
+
. Repeat the previous step for each resource-action pairing in the API.

== Working with the APIkit Console

By default, APIkit automatically opens an *APIkit Console* panel in Studio when you run a RAML-based APIkit project. APIkit Console gives you access to the generated documentation for the API. 

image:apiConsole.png[apiConsole]

To run the application _without_ automatically opening the APIkit Console:

. Right-click the project, then select *Run As* >** Run Configurations...**.
. Uncheck *Show APIkit console*.
. Click *Run*.

By default, the console is offered at the same host, port, and path as the routing flow listener, with the addition of the path `/console`. You can customize the path in the router global configuration. You can also disable the console completely.

image:routerconfig-console.png[routerconfig-console]

To access the console in a browser, go to the full address of your project routing flow and append the console path, `/console` by default, to the end of the address. For example, if your API is hosted at `http://localhost:8081/api`, then the URL for accessing the console is `http://localhost:8081/api/console.`

=== Using Policies with APIkit Console

APIkit Console XML code consists of two configurations so you can access APIkit Console even if a policy denies requests to the API:

----
<flow name="api-console">
   <http:listener config-ref="api-httpListenerConfig" path="/console/*" doc:name="HTTP"/>
   <apikit:console config-ref="api-config" doc:name="APIkit Console"/>
</flow>
----

The first configuration has a listener and is not affected by API policies. You use a URL that is not part of the `api` namespace, for example `/console` instead of `/api/console` to access the console having the listener configuration when a policy blocks access. 

The *Try It* functionality depends on the console configured in the second configuration, which you cannot access when governed by a blocking policy. Using Try It results in an error under these circumstances.

==== Enabling and Disabling APIkit Console

The consoleEnabled property only enables or disables the console that is exposed in the api namespace `/api/console`, which is the console configured in the second configuration. 

To disable the console you are exposing in "/console", you need to comment out the "api-6-console" flow; otherwise, you can use the link:/apikit/apikit-reference#apikit-config-attributes[consoleEnabled] property. If you are using a placeholder to enable/disable your console, you can use the following workaround:

----
<flow name="api-6-console">
   <http:listener config-ref="api-6-httpListenerConfig" path="/console/*" doc:name="HTTP"/>
     <choice doc:name="Choice">
        <when expression="${test}">
           <apikit:console config-ref="api-6-config" doc:name="APIkit Console"/>
        </when>
        <otherwise>
            <set-payload value="Resource not found" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
        </otherwise>
     </choice>
</flow>
----


=== Hosting Additional Consoles

Because the APIkit Console is a client that is accessing your API by making calls against it, hosting the console in the same URI as the API itself can cause policies to restrict calls more than you intended. Calls to populate the console and the favicon.ico count can have an impact, depending on applied policies. For example, if you applied a rate-limiting policy, loading the APIkit console consumes two of your allotted API calls, one to load the console in the browser and one for the favicon.ico. If your HTTP listener is protected with Basic Authentication, you need to authenticate in order to access or use the console. In particular, the APIkit Console doesn't know the steps of the OAuth dance, so if you apply an OAuth policy to the API, you will not be able to access the APIkit Console if you attempt to host multiple consoles in the same URI.

To host an additional console:

// source/create-additional-console.xml

. In the *Package Explorer*, select the API name in `src/main/app`.
. On the Global Elements tab, click *Create* and select *Connector Configuration* > *HTTP Listener Configuration*.
* Change the *Port* setting from 8081 to another port, for example 8083.
* Set the *Base Path* to `remote-vending/api/*`, the same base path you used for the first HTTP listener configuration. Click OK.
. On the *Message Flow* tab, drag an *HTTP Connector* onto the canvas to create a new flow in the project.
. Give the new flow an arbitrary name. For example, `api-console2`.
. In the properties editor, in *Connector Configuration*, select the new global HTTP listener configuration you created from the drop-down.
. In the Properties editor, set *Path* to a different path than you used for the first HTTP listener configuration. For example, set the path to `/console2/*`. Save the changes.
. Drag an *APIkit Console* standalone endpoint from the Mule Palette to the right of the HTTP listener.
+
The following code snippet shows the configurations added to enable a second console.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8083" basePath="remote-vending/api/*" doc:name="HTTP Listener Configuration"/>
...
<flow name="api-console2">
   <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/console2/*" doc:name="HTTP"/>
   <apikit:console config-ref="api-config" doc:name="APIkit Console"/>
</flow>
----
+
. Save all, right-click the API in Project Explorer, and choose *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
+
The additional console tab appears.
+
. Click the new tab.

== Using a Load Balancer

If your API implementation involves putting a load balancer in front of your APIkit application, configure the load balancer to redirect URLs that reference the `baseUri` of the application directly. If the load balancer does not redirect URLs, any calls that reach the load balancer looking for the application do not reach their destination. For example, you deploy an APIkit application to `myapp.mycompany.com`, and then add a load balancer at `www.exampleloadbalancer.com`. A call to the API arrives at `www.exampleloadbalancer.com` and the load balancer redirects the call to `myapp.mycompany.com` to get a response.
