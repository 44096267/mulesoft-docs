== APIkit OData Extension (Beta) Preliminary Documentation, October 2015

Using APIkit, you can create an APIs with OData support and deploy the API to CloudHub to expose as external datasources to Salesforce. You provide your OData entity model in Anypoint Studio, and APIKit scaffolds a Mule application that exposes an OData endpoint with the entities you provided. From Studio, you can run the application and deploy it to CloudHub; from within Salesforce you can register your app like any other application.

=== API Gateway and Studio Support

APIKit OData Extension is API Gateway 2.2.0 compatible. Update the versions of the dependencies in the `.pom` file to `APIKit 1.7.3` and `APIKit OData 0.9.1`. To use with API Gateway 2.2.0, right-click in Anypoint Studio, and select `Create Shared Domain`.

Studio 5.4 supports APIKit OData Extension. link:/release-notes/raml-1-early-access-support#apikit[Studio 6.x is not supported].

=== Assumptions

This page assumes basic reader familiarity with:

* link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio 5.4]
* link:/apikit/[APIKit]

=== Prerequisites

* Mule 3.7.x or API Gateway 2.2.x runtime
* APIKit with OData Extension, which you download from within Studio 5.4 
* The latest version of link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven]

=== Installing and Using the APIKit OData Extension

Once you have the latest version of Maven, and Anypoint Studio with the Mule 3.7 runtime, the basic high-level steps are the following:

. <<install,Install>> the APIKit extension in Studio, using the appropriate update site.
. <<import,Import>> a provided application template into Studio. This template greatly simplifies building the OData-enabled application.
. <<define,Define>> your OData entity model in the JSON file provided in the template.
. <<run_app,"Run APIKit">> to scaffold the application, generating a RAML file that exposes OData endpoints with the entities you defined.
. <<implement,Implement>> the flows in your application.
. Run your app locally, then deploy it to CloudHub.
. Register in Salesforce.

Using the template is recommended for building an OData-enabled application.


[[install]]
=== Installing the APIKit OData Extension in Studio

To install APIKit OData Extension, follow these steps:

. Under the *Help* menu in Anypoint Studio, select *Install New Software*.
. In the installation wizard's *Work with:* field, enter: `http://studio.mulesoft.org/r4/apikit-odata`.
. Studio displays a list of items to select. Click the checkboxes next to *APIKit Studio Plugin* and *RAML Editor*, then click *Next*.
. Studio displays details of the selected item. Click *Next*.
. Click to accept the terms and conditions of the product, then click *Finish*.
. Click *Restart Now* to complete the installation.

[[import]]
=== Importing the Template

. link:https://github.com/mulesoft/apikit-odata-template[Download] the template to use with the APIKit OData extension.
. Import the template into Studio:
.. Select *File* -> *Import*.
.. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/importing-and-exporting-in-studio[Import the Maven project]:In the *Import* dialog box, select *Anypoint Studio* -> *Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml*, then choose the `pom.xml` file from the location where you downloaded the template. 

[[define]]
=== Defining the Entity Model

. Once you have imported the template into Studio, the folders and files included in the template appear in Studio's *Package Explorer* pane on the left. In the Package Explorer, open the `src/main/api` folder, then open the file `model.json` for editing (right-click the file, then select *Open*).
. The `model.json` file contains the structure of the supported link:https://github.com/mulesoft/apikit-odata-template[entity model]. Enter the values for the entities and fields of your specific entity model. An link:_attachments/model-schema.json[example JSON schema file] is available.

[[run_app]]
=== Creating and Deploying the Application


. Once you have defined your entity model, use APIKit to generate the flows for the application. To do this: in the Package Explorer, right-click the application name or the `model.json` file, then select *APIKit* -> *Generate Flows*.
. When you generate the flows, APIKit generates a RAML file (`api.raml`) in the same folder as the `model.json` file. The `api.raml` file contains definitions for as many resources as there are entities in the `model.json` file that you edited. APIKit then scaffolds your OData endpoints as flows, which are defined in a file called `api.xml`. +

At this point, you can begin implementing the endpoints in the XML file. When implementing the endpoints, the flows' input and output *must* be in the JSON format. The input for each flow may contain the following variables:

* `orderby`
* `top`
* `skip`
* `filter`
* `expand`
* `format`
* `select`
* `inlinecount`
+
The output for each flow must conform to this format: +
`{"entries": [{<entry1>},{<entry2>},{<entryN>}]}`

. Package your app by running `mvn clean package`.
. Run your app locally.
. Deploy your app to CloudHub: Right-click your project, then select *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* -> *Cloud*. (For further details, see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloudHub].

=== Using the APIKit OData Extension Without the Template

Using the template is the quickest and easiest way to build your OData-enabled application; however, if you do not wish to use it, follow the steps below.

. Create a new Mule project with Maven support.
. In the application's `api` folder, create a new JSON file, for example `model.json`.
. Optionally, validate your JSON file against this link:_attachments/model-schema.json[JSON schema file].
. In the Package Explorer, right-click the project or the JSON file you created, then select *Mule* -> *Generate flows*.
. Add the following dependencies to the project `pom.xml` file: +
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-module-apikit</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.3</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-module-apikit-odata</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.1</version>
</dependency>
----
[start=6]
. On the scaffolded XML, implement the endpoints in the XML file. When implementing the endpoints, bear in mind that the input for each flow may contain the following variables:

* `orderby`
* `top`
* `skip`
* `filter`
* `expand`
* `format`
* `select`
* `inlinecount`
+
The output for each flow must conform to this format: +
`{"entries": [{<entry1>},{<entry2>},{<entryN>}]}`

. Package your app by running `mvn clean package`.
. Run your app locally.
. Deploy your app to CloudHub: Right-click your project, then select *CloudHub* -> *Deploy to CloudHub*. (For further details, see link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloudHub]).

== Supported Data Types

* link:https://github.com/mulesoft/apikit-odata-template/blob/master/README.md[README file] in the template for the OData-enabled application
* link:https://github.com/mulesoft/apikit-odata-template/blob/master/examples-edm-types.md[Examples of EDM types].

=== The entities Property

A single `entities` property contains an array of `entity` elements. To define the `entities` property:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "entities": [...]
}
----

=== The entity Element

Each entity must conform to the following structure:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "entity": {
        "name": "Employees",
        "remoteName": "Employees",
        "properties": [ ... ]
    }
}
----

* `name`: The name that the entity is exposed with, that is, the name that the consumers of this OData API uses to query this entity.

* `remoteName`: The name of the entity in the original/remote datasource, for example, the name of a table in a database.

* `properties`: An array containing the definition of each field in this entity, the definition of which is explained below.

==== Field Definitions

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "field": {
        "type": "Edm.Int32",
        "name": "id",
        "nullable": false,
        "key": true,
        "description": "This is the employee ID",
        "sample": "1"
    }
}
----

* `type`: The field's data type. *Mandatory* for all fields. For the full list of supported data types, see the template's link:https://github.com/mulesoft/apikit-odata-template/blob/master/README.md[README file].
* `name`: The name of the field. *Mandatory* for all types.
* `nullable` (boolean): Whether this field is nullable or not. *Mandatory* for all types.
* `key` (boolean): Whether this field is a key or not. *Mandatory* for all types.
* `description`: A description for the field. Optional for all types.
* `sample`: A sample value of data in this field. Optional for all types.
* `defaultValue`: A default value for this field. Optional for all types.
* `precision`: When in a field of type `Edm.DateTime`, `Edm.Time` or `Edm.DateTimeOffset`, indicates the granularity in fractions of a second, based on the number of decimal places supported -- for example, a precision of 3 means the granularity supported is milliseconds. When used in an `Edm.Decimal`, specifies the maximum number of decimal digits that an instance of can have, both to the left and to the right of the decimal point. Possible values for are 1, 2, or 3. Optional.
* `scale`: A positive integer that specifies the maximum number of decimal digits to the right of the decimal point that an instance of this type can have. The value can range from 0 through the specified precision value. The default value is 0. Optional for `Edm.Decimal` types.
* `maxLength`: *Mandatory* for `Edm.String` types. Specifies the maximum length that the instance can have, ranging from 0 to (2^31)-1.
* `fixedLength` (boolean): *Mandatory* for `Edm.String` types. Indicates whether the store requires a string to be fixed length or not.
* `collation` (string): Specifies the collating sequence (or sorting sequence) to be used for performing comparison and ordering operations over string values. Optional for `Edm.String` types.
* `unicode` (boolean): When set to true, dictates the string type that an instance stores. By default, UNICODE characters are used; otherwise standard ASCII encoding is used. The default value for this property is true. Optional for `Edm.String` types.
