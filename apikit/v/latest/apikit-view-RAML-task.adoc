= To View the RAML of an API

After you deploy an API, you configure an HTTP request to view the RAML specification of the API in API Console, assuming the API isn't blocked by a policy. 

. Set up a GET request.

. Use the following syntax to construct the URL: `<baseURL>/console/api/?raml` 
+
For example, http://0.0.0.0:8081/console/api/?raml/
+
. Set a Headers key to Accept and the value to application/raml+yaml.

. Send the request.

The RAML code for the API appears in the Body section.
