= To View the RAML of an API

When configuring an HTTP request after deployment, if the API is accessible, not blocked by a policy for example, you can use an HTTP client, such as Postman, to view the RAML specification of the API.

. Set up a GET request.

. Use the following syntax to construct the URL:
+
`<baseURL>/console/api/?raml`
+
. Set a Headers key to Accept and the value to application/raml+yaml.

. Send the request.
+
The RAML code for the API appears in the Body section.
