= Loan Broker BPM Example

The BPM example illustrates using a business process engine (JBoss jBPM) to orchestrate the loan broker application. Observe how the process flow and decision logic are cleanly defined in a process definition file (which could be created and maintained using a GUI process editor), while the systems integration and messaging is handled by Mule.

== Running the example

. Make sure you have met the prerequisites and installed Mule according to the [instructions].
. At the command line, navigate to the `examples/loanbroker-bpm` directory under your Mule home directory.
. Copy the pre-built example zip to the applications folder (`$MULE_HOME/apps`) and start Mule if it isn't already started.
. Go to the following URI in your browser to send a loan request (there are some default request values built-in): http://localhost:12081
. In the Mule log file, you should see the process execute and a response message such as the following from one of the banks:
+
----
 Returning Rate is: ABigBank, rate: 6.379575743481158
----

. Now, modify the loan amount requested, and see different banks responding based on the amount: http://localhost:12081/?amount=100
. Try different amounts (100, 10000, 20000). Also try invalid numbers to see the error handling in action.

=== Building the example

Run `mvn` from the example source folder. This will compile the example classes, produce an application zip file and copy it to `$MULE_HOME/apps`.

== Walking through the Mule Configuration

At the heart of the configuration is a Business Process Engine which receives and sends Mule messages. The messages which are received will start or advance a process execution, and the process execution will send messages to Mule endpoints.

*Process Engine Receives and Generates Events*

The Process Engine is an instance of http://www.jboss.org/jbpm[JBoss jBPM] and is configured using defaults as follows. For more information refer to the link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/BPM+Module+Reference[BPM Module Reference] documentation.

== Walking Through the jBPM Process

The first message to arrive at the BPM process will be a customer request for a loan. This message triggers the BPMS to start a new instance of the "LoanBroker" process. The message payload will be stored into the `customerRequest` process variable.

*Start State*

code,code-xml----
----
------------------- code,code-xml
<mule-receive name="incomingCustomerRequest" endpoint="CustomerRequests" var="customerRequest">
----
----
-------------------

The next step is to send the customer's information to the credit agency and get their credit report. The payload that we send to the credit agency comes from the `customerRequest` we just stored as a process variable.

*Generate a Message to Credit Agency*

code,code-xml----
----
------------ code,code-xml
<mule-send name="sendToCreditAgency" expr="#{customerRequest.customer}" endpoint="CreditAgency" synchronous="false">
----
----
------------

The request to the credit agency is asynchronous, so we now transition to a wait state until a response from the credit agency is received. Note that if a response is not received within four hours, the process times out and requires manual intervention.

*Wait state*

code,code-xml----
----
-------------- code,code-xml
<mule-receive name="waitForCreditAgency" endpoint="CreditProfiles" var="creditProfile">    <timer duedate="4 hours" />
----
----
--------------

Once a message is received from the credit agency, the next step prepares a loan request based on the two pieces of information we have received thus far (`customerRequest` and `creditProfile`). This invokes a POJO method using jPDL's standard `<java>` activity.

*Prepare Loan Quote Request*

code,code-xml----
----
----
----
----
----
-------- code,code-xml
<java name="prepareLoanQuoteRequest" class="org.mule.example.loanbroker.bpm.activity.PrepareLoanQuoteRequest" method="prepareRequest" var="loanRequest">    <arg><object expr="#{customerRequest}"/></arg>    <arg><object expr="#{creditProfile}"/></arg>    <transition to="sendToBanks" /></java>
----
----
----
----
----
----
--------

Now for the interesting part: the process itself decides which of the three banks, if any, to request a loan from on behalf of this customer. The loan amount, customer's credit history, and credit score are all taken into account. If the customer would not qualify for a loan from any of the three banks based on these criteria, the loan is denied.

*Decision Node*

<decision name="sendToBanks">    <transition to="sendToBigBank">        <condition expr="#{customerRequest.loanAmount >= 20000}" />        <condition expr="#{creditProfile.creditHistory >= 24}" />        <condition expr="#{creditProfile.creditScore >= 5}" />    </transition>    <transition to="sendToMediumBank">        <condition expr="#{customerRequest.loanAmount >= 10000}" />        <condition expr="#{creditProfile.creditHistory >= 12}" />        <condition expr="#{creditProfile.creditScore >= 3}" />    </transition>    <transition to="sendToSmallBank">        <condition expr="#{creditProfile.creditHistory >= 6}" />        <condition expr="#{creditProfile.creditScore >= 1}" />    </transition>    <!-- If the credit info. doesn't meet minimum requirements based on the loan amount, the loan is just denied. -->    <transition to="loanDenied" /></decision>

The final loan quote from the bank is validated and sent back to the customer, and the process ends up in one of two end states: `loanApproved` or `loanDenied`, depending on the outcome.

*Send Final Response and End Process*
