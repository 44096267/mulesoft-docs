= Anypoint Analytics - API Consumer
:keywords: analytics, consumer, api consumer, api

From the Developer portal, you can view the metrics associated with the API calls made by your client applications. The API metrics displayed include the number of API requests made by the application, the average latency to service a request, the percentage error ( blocked) rate of API calls, and breakdown of API calls by status code returned.

Viewing these metrics help you to manage API traffic, troubleshoot problems, and provide information to API users. For example, you could compare the API call rate to the SLA and take necessary actions if the API calls hit the SLA limits often, thus allowing you to proactively manage your applications. You could isolate performance issues by determining which APIs take longer to service requests, and also help troubleshoot by determining which APIs have a high error rate. As an API owner, if you want to chargeback based on API calls, then the API metrics in consumer dashboard could also be used to give visibility and transparency to organizations and applications being billed for calling your API.

== Consumer Metrics Reference

Graphs of API consumer data show aggregations over the following periods of time: 1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month (default), or 3 months. A zero value for a time period indicates insufficient data.

API Analytics groups metrics into these categories:

* Requests
+
Requests (Y axis) to your API over time (X axis). 
+
* Performance
+
Milliseconds (Y axis) on the average to receive and successfully complete a request  over time (X axis). Requests return an HTTP code 200 or 201.
+
* Blocked
+
The number of requests (Y axis) blocked due to networking issues over time (X axis). Requests return an HTTP error code 4xx or 5xx.
