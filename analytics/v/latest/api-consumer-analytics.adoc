= Anypoint Analytics - API Consumer
:keywords: analytics, consumer, api consumer, api

From the Developer portal, you can view the metrics associated with the API calls made by your client applications. The API metrics include the number of API requests made by the application, the average latency to service a request, the percentage error (blocked) rate of API calls, and a breakdown of API calls by returned status code.

Viewing these metrics helps you manage API traffic, troubleshoot problems, and provide information to API users. For example, to proactively manage your applications, you can compare the API call rate to the SLA and take necessary actions if the API calls hit the SLA limits often. You can isolate performance issues by determining which APIs take longer to service requests. Determining which APIs have a high error rate can help you troubleshoot problems. As an API owner, if you want to charge based on API calls, you can use the API metrics in the consumer dashboard to make API activity visibile and transparent to organizations and applications you are billing.

== Consumer Metrics Reference

Graphs of API consumer data show aggregations over the following periods of time: 1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month (default), or 3 months. A zero value for a time period indicates insufficient data.

API Analytics groups metrics into these categories:

* Requests
+
Requests (Y axis) to your API over time (X axis). 
+
* Performance
+
Milliseconds (Y axis) on the average to receive and successfully complete a request  over time (X axis). Requests return an HTTP code 200 or 201.
+
* Blocked
+
The number of requests (Y axis) blocked due to networking issues over time (X axis). Requests return an HTTP error code 4xx or 5xx.
