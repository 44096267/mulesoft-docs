= Anypoint Analytics Consumer API
:keywords: analytics, consumer api, consumer, api

The Anypoint Analytics Consumer API lets you ensure that the performance of your APIs meets the targets of your Service Level Access (SLA) tiers. For more information on SLA tiers, see the  link:/api-manager/defining-sla-tiers[Defining SLA Tiers] document.

== Accessing the Consumer API

To access the consumer API, ensure that you have previously created one or more applications that you wish to monitor. Each application needs to have at least one or more APIs for how users access your application.

You can access the Consumer API using link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] > *API Manager* > *Developer portal* > *My applications*.

When you view the Consumer API screens, each differs by the information in the detail information at the right of the screen for an API entry:

The sections that follow list each tab in this screen detail.

== Requests Tab Display

The Requests tab illustrates the number of requests that occur in the time period you specify:

The duration depends on what duration you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default value is one month.

The common elements in the Requests, Performance, and Blocked screens are:

[cols="30a,70a",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Edit |Edit the information for the current API such as the API name, version, SLA tier, and status.
|Reset Client Secret |Get a new client secret for the current API.
|Delete Application |Delete the current application. The interface prompts to ensure you really want to
complete this action.
|Application URL |URL for accessing the application.
|Redirect URIs |Alternate redirected URL to the API (if any).
|Client ID |A unique 64-bit identifier for the current API.
|Client Secret |A unique 64-bit secret value for the current API.
|API Name |The name of the API.
|API Version |The version of the API.
|SLA Tier |The current tier level for your software licensing agreement.
|Status |Indicates whether or not the SLA tier has been approved by MuleSoft.
|Request Tier Change |Button that enables you to request a different SLA tier level. You may consider raising the SLA tier level if the API performance consistently runs too low.
|Requests |Indicates the number of requests that occur each duration depending on what duration you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default value is one month.
|Performance |Indicates the performance of the requests that occur each duration depending on what duration you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default duration is one month. Performance is measured by the how many milliseconds it takes to complete each request. The left column indicates milliseconds against duration.
|Blocked |Indicates how many requests are blocking due to networking issues where requests return an HTTP error code of 4xx or 5xx such as 404 and 500. The left column indicates that the number of blocked requests per duration depending on what duration you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default duration is one month.
|Tier |The current SLA tier for the API.
|Description |Description of the API.
|Limits |Any limits placed on the API.

== Performance Tab Display

The Performance tab illustrates the performance for how quickly requests are moving through an API. Performance is a measure of the duration a request takes to successfully complete where it gets an HTTP code of 200 or 201:

The duration depends on what duration you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default value is one month.

See xref:commonelements[Common Elements] for a description of each possible value on the screen.

== Blocked Tab Display

The Blocked tab illustrates how many requests are failing to complete and accruing an HTTP error code of 4xx or 5xx, such as 404 or 500. The number of blocked requests can indicate a measure of network performance or whether or not an SLA tier is adequate for the volume of requests that an API receives.

The duration depends on what duration you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default value is one month.

See xref:commonelements[Common Elements] for a description of each possible value on the screen.
