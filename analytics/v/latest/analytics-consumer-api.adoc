= Anypoint Analytics Consumer API
:keywords: analytics, consumer api, consumer, api

The Anypoint Analytics Consumer API lets you ensure that the performance of your APIs meets the targets of your Service Level Access (SLA) tiers. The Consumer API measures the number of requests for an API, performance, and the number of blocked requests.

The use cases for the Consumer API are:

* *SLA Performance* - Ensuring that your APIs are performing in line with the SLA tier approved for an API.
* *Troubleshooting* - Determining which APIs are receiving more or fewer requests, and which APIs are being blocked (where requests fail with a 4xx or 5xx HTTP error code, such as a 404 or 500).

For more information on SLA tiers, see the  link:/api-manager/defining-sla-tiers[Defining SLA Tiers] and link:/api-manager/tutorial-manage-an-api#adding-an-sla-tier[Adding an SLA Tier] documents.

NOTE: The Consumer API is essentially a visual indicator where you can view API performance over a duration. The performance data is not logged, and no notifications are generated if the performance falls off or the number of blocked requests increase. Administrators should regularly review the Consumer API screens to ensure APIs are performing as expected.

== Accessing the Consumer API

To access the consumer API, ensure that you have previously created one or more applications that you wish to monitor. Each application needs to have at least one or more APIs for how users access your application.

You can access the Consumer API using link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] > *API Manager* > *Developer portal* > *My applications*.

When you view the Consumer API screens, each differs by the information in the detail information at the right of the screen for an API entry. You can move the cursor over the Requests, Performance, or Blocked tab data to view breakouts over the duration range. A zero value in the breakouts indicates that not enough data was available to provide meaningful information.

The sections that follow list each tab in this screen detail.

== Requests Tab Display

The Requests tab illustrates the number of requests that occur in the time period you specify. The left column indicates the number of requests.

The duration depends on what duration range you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default value is one month.

=== Consumer API Screen Elements

The elements in the Requests, Performance, and Blocked screens are:

[cols="30a,70a",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Edit |Edit the information for the current API such as the API name, version, SLA tier, and status.
|Reset Client Secret |Get a new client secret for the current API.
|Delete Application |Delete the current application. The interface prompts to ensure you really want to
complete this action.
|Application URL |URL for accessing the application.
|Redirect URIs |Alternate redirected URL to the API (if any).
|Client ID |A unique 64-bit identifier for the current API.
|Client Secret |A unique 64-bit secret value for the current API.
|API Name |The name of the API.
|API Version |The version of the API.
|SLA Tier |The current tier level for your software licensing agreement.
|Status |Indicates whether or not the SLA tier has been approved by the application's owner. For more information on SLA tier status, see link:/api-manager/defining-sla-tiers[Defining SLA Tiers] and link:/api-manager/tutorial-manage-an-api#adding-an-sla-tier[Adding an SLA Tier].
|Request Tier Change |Button that enables you to request a different SLA tier level. You may consider raising the SLA tier level if the API performance is consistently too low.
|Requests |Indicates the number of requests that occur each duration depending on what duration range you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default value is one month.
|Performance |Indicates the performance of the successful requests that occur each duration depending on what duration range you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default duration is one month. Performance is measured by the how many milliseconds it takes to receive and successfully complete a request. The left column indicates milliseconds against duration.
|Blocked |Indicates how many requests are blocking due to networking issues where requests return an HTTP error code of 4xx or 5xx such as 404 and 500. The left column indicates that the number of blocked requests per duration depending on what duration range you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default duration is one month.
|Tier |The current SLA tier for the API.
|Description |Description of the API.
|Limits |Any limits placed on the API.
|===

== Performance Tab Display

The Performance tab illustrates the performance for how quickly requests are moving through an API. Performance is a measure of the duration a request takes to successfully complete where it gets an HTTP code of 200 or 201. Performance is measured by the how many milliseconds it takes to receive and complete a request. The left column indicates the milliseconds needed to receive and successfully complete a request to the API. The important takeaway is to see at which time performance is highest or lowest.

The duration depends on what duration you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default value is one month.

See <<Consumer API Screen Elements>> for a description of each possible value on the screen.

== Blocked Tab Display

The Blocked tab illustrates how many requests are failing to complete and accruing an HTTP error code of 4xx or 5xx, such as 404 or 500. The number of blocked requests can indicate a measure of network performance or whether or not an SLA tier is adequate for the volume of requests that an API receives. The left column indicates the number of blocked requests.

The duration depends on what duration you click (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or 3 months). The default value is one month.

See <<Consumer API Screen Elements>> for a description of each possible value on the screen.
