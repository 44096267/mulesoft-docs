This procedure enables you to run multiple instances of Tcat Server on a single machine, using one instance of the Tcat Administration Console (or more) to manage multiple instances of Tcat Server, each running within their own JVM.

== Install Tcat Server with Administration Console

This process explains how to *install* multiple Tcat Server instances on one machine, then use the Administration Console to *manage*, *monitor*, and *deploy* servers and applications.

=== Before You Begin

For this procedure, you need a working installation of Java JDK or JRE 1.5 or better (JDK is preferred as it provides for additional utilities).

Ensure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set correctly.

Download the Tcat Server installer for Windows (.exe), Linux (.sh), Solaris (.sh), and MacOS (.dmg) from http://www.mulesoft.com/download-tcat-server-enterprise-tomcat.

=== Step One: Run Installer, Accepting All Defaults

Select Standard Install, and accept all defaults

|===
|Windows |Linux |Solaris |OS X
|installer.exe |installer.sh |installer.sh |installer.dmg

[NOTE]
*After the first install, start the server and leave it running.*

== Install Additional Tcat Servers

In this step, you will run the installer again, selecting Custom and determining the ports for HTTP, HTTPS redirect, Tcat Server Shutdown and AJP connector port.

=== Run the Tcat Installer with Options

Perform the following steps for each additional instance you want to have locally installed.

. Run the installer. At Select Installation Type, choose Custom Installation.
. At the next window, deselect Administration Console from the list.
. At the Port Settings page, enter unique port numbers according to the following table:

[NOTE]
Make sure that you only use the following settings for a single instance. Every other instance must use a different port assignment for each setting.

[width="99",cols="50,50",options="header"]
|===
|Port |Default
|HTTP/1.1 |8080
|redirectPort |8443
|Server SHUTDOWN |8005
|AJP/1.3 Connector |8009
|securePort |51443
|===

== Startup Tcat Server instances

Start all the Tcat Server instances. (The the one with the Administration Console should already be running.)

[width="99",cols="25,25,25,25",options="header"]
|===
|Windows |Linux |Solaris |OS X
|bin/tcat6 start a|
* as administrator: sudo service tcat6 start

 |sudo svcadm enable tcat6 |catalina.sh start
|  a|
* as non-administrator: cd /opt/TcatServer6/bin/tcat6 start

 |  | 
|===

== Login, Register, and Manage Tcat Servers

*NOTE* if you are connected to your network via a virtual private network (VPN), disconnect before running Tcat Server. After you have registered all your Tcat Server instances, you can connect to your VPN again.

=== Login to Administration Console

. After a minute or two, open a Web browser to the following address: http://localhost:8080/console
. Log in using "admin" for both username and password
. The Tcat Server console appears, with the Servers tab selected by default

=== Register Servers

. In the left panel, click Unregistered
. The local Tcat Server instance appears to the right
. Click the checkbox next to Server Name
. Click Register
. The local server instance now appears in the All group with a green status indicator

Repeat for each Tcat Server instance you installed.

=== Manage Servers

. Click the All list in the left panel
. Click on Server Name
. The Server Details panel appears
. Click through the tabs to view the information and operations available
. Click on Server Summary to verify secure port numbers are distinct

=== Rename Servers

. From the Servers tab in the Administration Console, click on one Tcat Server instance
. The Server Summary appears
. Click Edit Server Info
. Enter a unique name in Server Name
. Click Save
. The new server name appears immediately in the list of Servers

=== Rules About securePort Setting

. Any port number from 1 to 65535 if the Tomcat JVM runs as root. Any number from 1024 to 65535 if the Tomcat JVM runs as a user other than root.
. Must not conflict with any of the other TCP ports being used by Tomcat and/or webapps running in the same JVM that have opened server sockets.

*NOTE* On non-Windows OSs, ports 1-1023 inclusive are "privileged ports" and require root privileges to bind to them. Those are the only special port numbers, and only on non-Windows OSs.
