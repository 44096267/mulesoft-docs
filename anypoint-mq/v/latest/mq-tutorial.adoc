:keywords: mq, tutorial, queue, exchange, client, studio, postman

This guide walks through the complete process of creating a queue and publishing to and consuming from a Mule message in the queue.

== Prerequisites

* Read link:/anypoint-mq/mq-understanding[Understanding Anypoint MQ] to familiarize yourself with the terminology and
concepts of using MQ.
* Create an link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] account to configure user permissions, register applications in MQ, and to create queues and exchanges.
* link:http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-subscription[Subscribe]Â to Mule ESB Enterprise - An Enterprise license is required to
use the MQ server software.
* Install link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio]. We use Studio to create each application that talks to
MQ over HTTP.
* Install the link:https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Chrome browser]. Chrome provides valuable developer
tools and supports the use of plugins such as Postman, which sends HTTP commands to the MQ server.
* Install the open-source link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en[Chrome Postman plugin] - We use Postman to send HTTP commands to the MQ server.

|1 |<<Configure Anypoint Platform>>
|Use link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] to:

.. <<Assign User Permissions>> - Give yourself permission to view the user interface - Good model for when you add users in your organization to MQ.
.. <<Create an Admin Role>> - Create an admin's role for all permissions - Helps you define who in your organization should administer MQ versus have lesser permissions.
.. <<Create a Queue>> - Create a queue where MQ messages are published and consumed by applications.
.. <<Register a Client Application>> - Register an application at the MQ server so that the application can publish messages
and consume messages. The MQ server provides a client ID and client secret that you use with Anypoint Studio.
|2 |<<Configuring Anypoint Studio for MQ>> |Obtain the MQ connector and create a flow for publishing or consuming messages.
|3 |<<Send HTTP Requests>> |Use the Chrome open-source Postman plugin to send messages to the MQ server.

== Configure Anypoint Platform

In the sections that follow, we use Anypoint Platform to assign an administrative role, create an application, and create an exchange.

=== Assign User Permissions

Assign user permissions to yourself for use with MQ. These permissions let you create client applications, and destinations by creating queues and exchanges. You can use this same information to assign user permissions for others in your organization.

To assign user permissions:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click the gear icon and *Users*:
+
image:mq-tut-gear-and-users.png[mq-tut-gear-and-users]
+
. Click your username value:
+
image:mq-tut-click-username.png[mq-tut-click-username]
+
. Click *MQ* and click the green box to set an environment and permissions:
+
image:mq-tut-users-mq.png[mq-tut-users-mq]
+
. After you click the green box, the field changes to *+ Add an environment by name*. Click the plus sign *+* and in the drop-down menu, click *Production* as shown in this composite illustration:
+
image:mq-tut-env-permissions.png[mq-tut-env-permissions]
+
. Under *Permission(s)*, click *Select Access* > *Select All*. When you click *Select All*, `Select Access` changes to *Manage destinations, Manage clients, (Total: 5)* to show which which permissions you chose.
+
image:mq-tut-manager-dests.png[mq-tut-manager-dests]
+
. Click the green checkmark to save your settings: image:mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon.png[mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon]
+
A summary list appears:
+
image:mq-tut-permissions-summary.png[mq-tut-permissions-summary]
+
You can use this display to delete permissions if needed. For this tutorial, you can leave all as shown.

=== Create an Admin Role

After you create permissions for yourself, you can create a role that you can apply to other users in your organization.
While you don't need roles to complete this tutorial, when you use MQ as an administrator or developer, you should create
roles for all those in your organization who use MQ. After the previous section where you assigned permissions to yourself,
the steps to create a role are very similar and this exercise takes little extra time now and benefits you later.

Creating a role lets you create permissions depending on each user's function in your organization, such as for administrators, developers, or for those who only view information but don't change it.

In this tutorial, we grant all permissions to the `MQ Admin` role. When you create other roles for your organization, you can change the permissions as required.

To assign role permissions:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click the gear icon and *Roles*:
+
image:mq-tut-gear-and-roles.png[mq-tut-gear-and-roles]
+
. Click *Add role*.
+
image:mq-tut-add-role-for-admin.png[mq-add-role-for-admin]
+
. Specify an administrator's role for those who create client apps, queues, and exchanges.
. Click *Add role*.
. Click the Role name and click *MQ*.
. Click the green bar, click the plus sign for *Add an environment by name*, and choose the *Production* environment.
+
image:mq-tut-set-role-env.png[mq-tut-set-role-env]
+
. Click *Permission(s)* > *Select Access* > *Select All*. When you click Select All, Select Access, changes to *Manage destinations, Manage clients, (Total: 5)*:
+
image:mq-tut-permissions.png[mq-tut-permissions]
+
. Click the green checkmark on the right to save your changes: image:mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon.png[mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon]

=== Create a Queue

A queue provides a temporary stack for holding messages. Applications push messages to the queue and other applications consume
the messages. An application that intends to consume messages either acks (acknowledges) the message acquires the message contents, or nacks (negative acknowledgement) the message to indicate that the application does not want to consume that message.
When an application acks a message, MQ locks the message for a limited duration so only the application can consume it, and then removes the message after the application consumes the message.

To create a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top taskbar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the blue plus circle.
. Specify the queue name `MyDemoQueue`. For this tutorial, you can leave the time-to-live (TTL) durations as shown, and leave the queue unencrypted.
. Click the queue name to list its details. After we create applications in Anypoint Studio, we return to the queue detail screen
to see which messages are available and which are in flight.


=== Register a Client Application

MQ provides the *Client Application* settings so that you can register each application that you want to communicate through MQ.
For each application you register, MQ creates a client ID and a client secret that you plug into your application.
These credentials enable MQ to recognize your application when your application publishes a message to a queue or exchange, and when an application consumes a message from a queue.

To register a client application:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *MQ* in the top taskbar:
+
image:mq-tut-mq-taskbar.png[mq-tut-mq-taskbar]
+
. Click *Client Apps*:
+
image:mq-tut-client-apps.png[mq-tut-client-apps]
+
. Click the blue plus *+* button:
+
image:mq-tut-blue-create-button.png[mq-tut-blue-create-button]
+
. Specify an application name such as `DemoClientApp` and click *Save Changes*.
+

We use this information in the next section on configuring Anypoint Studio.

== Configuring Anypoint Studio for MQ

In this section, we use Anypoint Studio to create a simple application that you can use
to send a message to a queue, or to consume the message, and to ack.

For this section, you need to have the client ID and secret you created
in <<Register a Client Application>>, so have Anypoint Platform > *MQ* > *Client App* 
open to copy the information to your Studio application.

To configure Studio:

. Download and install the latest link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Studio] version.
. In Studio, click *Help* > *Install New Software*.
. Paste this URL into the *Work with* field and press `Enter`:
+
`http://studio.mulesoft.org/r4/addons/beta`
+
. Click the checkbox for *Anypoint Messaging Connector* and click *Next*:
+
image:mq-connector-install.png[Type URL and click Anypoint Messaging Connector]
+
. Follow the prompts to install the software.
. Create a new Mule Project. Click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Search for "transform" and drag the *Transform Message* icon to the canvas. You can rename  Transform Message to a new value by right-clicking the icon and selecting *Rename*. For the example flow, rename the icon to "Create Customer".
. Use the DataWeave syntax to specify firstname, lastname, and company values:
+

+
. Search for "mq" and drag the Anypoint MQ connector icon to the canvas.
+
image:mq-connector-visual-flow.png[mq-connector-visual-flow]
+
. Click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*.
. In the Global Element Properties window plug in the information from Anypoint Platform:
.. Copy the *Client App* > *Client App ID* value to Studio's *Client ID* field.
.. Copy the *Client App* > *Client Secret* value to Studio's *Client Secret* field.
.. Click OK.
. Click the *Operation* field and specify an operation such as Publish or Consume.
. Specify the *Destination* as the name of the Queue or Exchange that you set in Anypoint Platform.
