:keywords: mq, tutorial, queue, exchange, client, studio, postman

This guide walks through the complete process of creating a queue and publishing to and consuming from a Mule message in the queue.

== Prerequisites

* Read link:/anypoint-mq/mq-understanding[Understanding Anypoint MQ] to familiarize yourself with the terminology and concepts of using MQ.
* Create an link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] account to configure user permissions, register applications in MQ, and to create queues and exchanges.
* link:http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-subscription[Subscribe]Â to Mule ESB Enterprise - An Enterprise license is required to
use the MQ server software.
* Install link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio]. We use Studio to create each application that talks to
MQ over HTTP.
* Install link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-enterprise[Mule Runtime]. After doing so, locate the `bin` directory. We start Mule from this directory.

|# |Task |Description
|1 |<<Configure Anypoint Platform>>
|Use link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] to:

.. <<Assign User Permissions>> - Give yourself permission to view the user interface - Good model for when you add users in your organization to MQ.
.. <<Create an Admin Role>> - Create an admin's role for all permissions - Helps you define who in your organization should administer MQ versus have lesser permissions.
.. <<Create a Queue and an Exchange>> - Create a queue where MQ messages are published and consumed by applications.
.. <<Send and Receive a Message for a Queue>> - Send the demo
queue a message and then get the message.
.. <<Send a Message to an Exchange>> - Send the demo
exchange a message and then get the message from the demo queue.
|2 |<<Configure Anypoint Studio for MQ>> |Use Anypoint Platform to register a client application and get values for the Client ID and Client Secret. Then in Anypoint Studio, get the MQ connector and create a flow for publishing or consuming messages, and run the Mule Application to ensure your application works and to serve HTTP requests at your localhost.
|3 |<<Send and Receive Messages>> |Use the MQ > Messages feature in Anypoint Platform to send and receive messages.

== Configure Anypoint Platform

In the sections that follow, we use Anypoint Platform to assign an administrative role, create an application, and create an exchange.

=== Assign User Permissions

Assign user permissions to yourself for use with MQ. These permissions let you create client applications, and destinations by creating queues and exchanges. You can use this same information to assign user permissions for others in your organization.

To assign user permissions:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click the gear icon and *Users*:
+
image:mq-tut-gear-and-users.png[mq-tut-gear-and-users]
+
. Click your username value:
+
image:mq-tut-click-username.png[mq-tut-click-username]
+
. Click *MQ* and click the green box to set an environment and permissions:
+
image:mq-tut-users-mq.png[mq-tut-users-mq]
+
. After you click the green box, the field changes to *+ Add an environment by name*. Click the plus sign *+* and in the drop-down menu, click *Production* as shown in this composite illustration:
+
image:mq-tut-env-permissions.png[mq-tut-env-permissions]
+
. Under *Permission(s)*, click *Select Access* > *Select All*. When you click *Select All*, `Select Access` changes to *Manage destinations, Manage clients, (Total: 5)* to show which which permissions you chose.
+
image:mq-tut-manager-dests.png[mq-tut-manager-dests]
+
. Click the green checkmark to save your settings: image:mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon.png[mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon]
+
A summary list appears:
+
image:mq-tut-permissions-summary.png[mq-tut-permissions-summary]
+
You can use this display to delete permissions if needed. For this tutorial, you can leave all as shown.

=== Create an Admin Role

After you create permissions for yourself, you can create a role that you can apply to other users in your organization.
While you don't need roles to complete this tutorial, when you use MQ as an administrator or developer, you should create
roles for all those in your organization who use MQ. After the previous section where you assigned permissions to yourself,
the steps to create a role are very similar and this exercise takes little extra time now and benefits you later.

Creating a role lets you create permissions depending on each user's function in your organization, such as for administrators, developers, or for those who only view information but don't change it.

In this tutorial, we grant all permissions to the `MQ Admin` role. When you create other roles for your organization, you can change the permissions as required.

To assign role permissions:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click the gear icon and *Roles*:
+
image:mq-tut-gear-and-roles.png[mq-tut-gear-and-roles]
+
. Click *Add role*.
+
image:mq-tut-add-role-for-admin.png[mq-add-role-for-admin]
+
. Specify an administrator's role for those who create client apps, queues, and exchanges.
. Click *Add role*.
. Click the Role name and click *MQ*.
. Click the green bar, click the plus sign for *Add an environment by name*, and choose the *Production* environment.
+
image:mq-tut-set-role-env.png[mq-tut-set-role-env]
+
. Click *Permission(s)* > *Select Access* > *Select All*. When you click Select All, Select Access, changes to *Manage destinations, Manage clients, (Total: 5)*:
+
image:mq-tut-permissions.png[mq-tut-permissions]
+
. Click the green checkmark on the right to save your changes: image:mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon.png[mq-tut-green-checkmark-icon]

=== Create a Queue and an Exchange

A queue provides a temporary stack for holding messages. Applications push messages to the queue and other applications consume
the messages. An application that intends to consume messages either acks (acknowledges) the message acquires the message contents, or nacks (negative acknowledgement) the message to indicate that the application does not want to consume that message.
When an application acks a message, MQ locks the message for a limited duration so only the application can consume it, and then removes the message after the application consumes the message.

An exchange is a collection of one or more queues.
An exchange lets you send one message that can appear on
multiple queues. Exchanges let you organize queues within
your organization, or to use exchanges to send specific
types of messages.

==== Create a Queue

To create a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top taskbar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the blue plus circle.
. Click *Queue*.
+
image:mq-create-demo-queue.png[mq-create-demo-queue, width="400"]
+
. Specify the name `MyDemoQueue`. For this tutorial, you can leave the time-to-live (TTL) durations as shown, and leave the queue unencrypted.
. Click *Save Changes*.
. In the Destinations screen. click the queue name to list its details.

==== Create an Exchange

To create an exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].

. Click the checkbox to bind MyDemoQueue to this exchange.
. Click *Save Changes*.
. In the Destinations screen. click the exchange name to list its details.

=== Send and Receive a Message for a Queue

Anypoint Platform lets you access a feature where you can send
messages to a queue and then view them. The messages content can
be text, JSON, or CSV.

==== Send a Message to the Queue

To send a message to a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top taskbar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the MyDemoQueue entry in Destinations to view details about
the queue.

=== Send a Message to an Exchange

== Configure Anypoint Studio for MQ

In this section, we use Anypoint Studio to create a simple application that you can use
to publish a message to a queue, or to consume the message, and to ack and nack the message.

First, return to Anypoint Platform and register an application that we can use in Studio.

=== Register a Client Application

Anypoint Platform > MQ provides the *Client Application* settings so that you can register each application that you want to communicate through MQ.
For each application you register, MQ creates a client ID and a client secret that you plug into your application in Anypoint Studio.
These credentials enable the MQ server to recognize your application when your application publishes a message to a queue or exchange, and when an application consumes a message from a queue.

To register a client application:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *MQ* in the top taskbar:
+
image:mq-tut-mq-taskbar.png[mq-tut-mq-taskbar]
+
. Click *Client Apps*:
+
image:mq-tut-client-apps.png[mq-tut-client-apps]
+
. Click the blue plus *+* button:
+
image:mq-tut-blue-create-button.png[mq-tut-blue-create-button]
+
. Specify an application name such as `DemoClientApp` and click *Save Changes*.
+
image:mq-tut-create-client-app.png[mq-tut-create-client-app]

*Note*: Leave the *Client Apps* window open. We need to copy and paste the Client ID and Client Secret
into the configuration for Anypoint Studio in the next step.

=== Configure Studio for the Anypoint MQ Connector Plugin

To configure Studio:

. Download and install the latest link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Studio] version.
. In Studio, click *Help* > *Install New Software*.
. Paste this URL into the *Work with* field and press `Enter`:
+
`http://studio.mulesoft.org/r4/addons/beta`
+
. Click the checkbox for *Anypoint Messaging Connector* and click *Next*:
+
image:mq-connector-install.png[Type URL and click Anypoint Messaging Connector]
+
. Follow the prompts to install the software.

=== Use Studio to Create an Application

To create an application:

. Create a new Mule Project. Click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Search for "http" and drag the *HTTP Connector* to the Studio Canvas.
Here's how the Canvas appears after pulling all the building blocks to
the Canvas:
+
image:mq-connector-visual-flow.png[mq-connector-visual-flow]
+
.. Search for "set" and drag *Set Payload* to the Canvas.
.. Search for "mq" and drag the *Anypoint MQ* connector icon to the canvas.
.. Search for "logger" and drag *Logger* to the Canvas.

+
image:mq-http-connector.png[mq-http-connector]
+
. In the HTTP Connector's Global Element Properties, set the host to *localhost* and the port to *8081*. Click *OK*.
+
image:mq-http-connector-globals.png[mq-http-connector-globals]
+
. Set the *Path* to `/mq/{messageId}`.
. Click *Set Payload* in the Canvas and set the *Value* to:
+
[source,code]
----
#[message.inboundProperties.'http.uri.params'.messageId]
----
+
. Click the *MQ Connector* and click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*:
. In the MQ Connector's Global Element Properties window, add the information from Anypoint Platform:
+
image:mq-connector-properties.png[mq-connector-properties]
+
.. Copy the *Client App* > *Client App ID* value to Studio's *Client ID* field.
.. Copy the *Client App* > *Client Secret* value to Studio's *Client Secret* field.
+
You can ignore the remaining fields.
+
.. Click *OK*.
. Click the *Operation* field and specify an operation such as `publish` or `consume`.
. Specify the *Destination* as the name of the Queue or Exchange that you set in Anypoint Platform:
+
image:mq-destination-queue.png[mq-destination-queue]
+
. Click the *Logger* and set the Message field to:
+
*MQ Message: #[payload]*
+
