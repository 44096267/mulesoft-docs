= Anypoint MQ Acknowledgements Mode - DRAFT
:keywords: mq, ack, exception, strategy, mode

Anypoint MQ lets you determine how to process messages in Anypoint Studio using the MQ Connector. The acknowledgement mode lets you set these behaviors when an application receives a message from a queue:

* *Manual* - An application sets its own outcomes for what to do when a message is available or not available.
* *None* - An application receives a message and does no further processing.
* *Auto* - An application uses an exception strategy to catch events that the MQ Connector generates.
