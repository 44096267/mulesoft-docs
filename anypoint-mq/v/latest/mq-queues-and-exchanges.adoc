:keywords: mq, destinations, queues, exchanges, client application

Anypoint MQ is a messaging broker that lets applications communicate by publishing a Mule Message to a queue so that another application can consume the message.

This guide describes how to create a queue, exchange, and client application using Anypoint Platform.

== Create a Queue

You can use Anypoint Platform to create queues and exchanges.

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *MQ* in the taskbar:

+
. In the *Create Queues* window, provide a queue name, and if needed, change the time-to-live default values for how long a message persists before being automatically deleted, and how long you can apply a lock to a message so that an application has exclusive access to the message. The default values you set affect the settings in the xref:createapp[client apps] you create.
. If needed, mark the queue so that any messages that arrive in the queue get encrypted using password-based encryption (PBE) with MD5 and  DES. To mark the queue, slide the Encryption slider to the right.
