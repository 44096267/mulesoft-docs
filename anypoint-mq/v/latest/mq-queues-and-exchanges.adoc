= Anypoint MQ Queues and Exchanges
:keywords: mq, destinations, queues, exchanges, client application

Anypoint MQ is a messaging broker that lets applications communicate by publishing a Mule Message to a queue so that another application can consume the message.

This guide describes how to create a queue, exchange, and client application using Anypoint Platform.

*Note*: Queue and exchange names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed. Queue and exchange names are limited to 128 characters in length.

Organization administrators or owners can view the current and past months usage - the total number of messages and API requests. This information is accessed from the Access Management page. For more information, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-usage[Anypoint MQ Usage Information].


== Create a Queue

A queue is a temporary storage area for a message.

To create a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *MQ* from the left navigation bar or click *MQ* from the main Anypoint Platform screen:
+
image:mq-ap-access.png[mq-ap-access]
+
. Click *Destinations*:
+
image:mq-destinations-option.png[mq-destinations-option]
+
. Click the blue plus circle.
. Click *Queue*.
+
In the *Create Queue* screen:
+
image:mq-create-q-screen.png[mq-create-q-screen]
+
.. Specify a name.
+
NOTE: MQ queue names can contain these characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period (.), and hyphen (-). Queue names cannot contain spaces or other characters, and can be up to 127 characters in length.
+
.. (Optional) Change the time-to-live (TTL) durations for:
*** Default Message TTL - How long unprocessed messages persist before being deleted.
*** Default Lock TTL - If there is a server failure and a message is not acknowledged, specifies the duration that a message would wait before being put back into the queue. A locked message does not block other messages to be read. The lock makes a message unavailable to other applications while locked.
+
The duration for each TTL can be from milliseconds up to 14 days.
.. (Optional) Set the queue to encrypted. Anypoint MQ uses PBE with MD5 and triple DES to encrypt messages.
.. Click *Save Changes*.
. In the Destinations screen, click the queue name to list its details:
+

The next section describes how Anypoint Platform lets you send
messages to a queue and view, return the messages to the queue, or delete the messages.
Message content (called a payload) can be text, JSON, or CSV (comma-separated values).

NOTE: If you need to delete a queue, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq#how-do-i-delete-a-queue[How do I delete a queue?]

=== Send a Message to a Queue

To send a message to a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the queue entry in Destinations to view details about
the queue.
. Click the queue name in the details to open the Messaging feature:
+
image:mq-access-messaging2.png[mq-access-messaging2]
+
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-sender2.png[mq-click-msg-sender2]
+
. Type text in the *Payload* such as `Hello Mules` (leave the *Type* field set to *Text*):
+
image:mq-msg-sender-text-payload2.png[mq-msg-sender-text-payload2]
+
. Click *Send*.

=== Verify the Message in a Queue

To verify that the message arrived in the queue, either return to the Destinations screen to observe the number of messages in the queue, or you can assume the message is in the queue, and you can <<Get a Message From a Queue>>.

To return to the Destinations screen to verify that the message is in the queue:

. Click *Destinations*:
+
image:mq-click-destinations2.png[mq-click-destinations2]
+
. Click the queue to see the queue detail. The detail shows that a message is in
the queue:
+
image:mq-msgs-in-queue2.png[mq-msgs-in-queue2]

=== Get a Message From a Queue

To get a message from a queue:

. Follow the directions in <<Send a Message to a Queue>> and
advance to Step 6, except click *Message Browser*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-browser2.png[mq-click-msg-browser2]
+
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
image:mq-get-messages2.png[mq-get-messages2]
+
. Click the message ID value to view the message.
+
image:mq-click-id2.png[mq-click-id2]
+
. If you want to return the message to the queue, such as if other applications
may also want to read the message, click the *Return Messages* icon - this
is the default condition. If you switch screens back to the Message Sender
or to Destinations, messages automatically return to the queue.
In Anypoint MQ, returning the messages to the queue is known
as `nack` - the message is not altered. However,
the time to live (TTL) value you set when you created your queue
determines how long the message is available before Anypoint MQ deletes it.
+
image:mq-click-retmsgs2.png[mq-click-retmsgs2]
+
Alternatively, you can delete the message by clicking the trash can icon. In Anypoint MQ, deleting a message is called an `ack` - For information on how Anypoint MQ processes ack  messages for you, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-ack-mode[Acknowledgement Mode].
+
image:mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2.png[mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2]

Now you are able to send and receive messages in Anypoint MQ.

NOTE: In Anypoint MQ, messages are read through long polling where the server holds the request open until new data is available. Anypoint MQ delivers a batch of messages with a single read.

Organization administrators or owners can view the current and past months usage - the total number of messages and API requests. This information is accessed from the Access Management page. For more information, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-usage[Anypoint MQ Usage Information].

In the next section, you can try
alternate ways of formatting messages.

=== Send a CSV or JSON Message

To send a JSON message:

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
+
. Click *Message Browser* and the message ID to view the message:
+
image:mq-json-get-msg2.png[mq-json-get-msg2]

To send a CSV message:

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *CSV*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,code]
----
"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
+
. Click *Message Browser* and the message ID to view the message.

== Create an Exchange

An exchange lets you send a message to one or more queues that are bound to the exchange.

Before creating an exchange, create one or more queues. For more information, see
<<Create a Queue>>.

To create an exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *MQ* from the left navigation area or the Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the blue plus circle.
. Click *Exchange*.
+
image:mq-create-an-exchange.png[mq-create-an-exchange]
+
. Name the exchange. For example, if the exchange is called MyDemoExchange and a queue, MyDemoQueue, the Create Exchange screen is:
+
image:mq-name-the-exchange.png[mq-name-the-exchange]
+
NOTE: MQ exchange names can only contain these characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period (.), and hyphen (-). Exchange names cannot contain spaces or other characters, and the name can be up to 127 characters in length.
+
. Click the checkbox to bind MyDemoQueue to this exchange.
. Click *Save Changes*.
. In the Destinations screen. click the exchange name to list its details:
+
image:mq-exchange-details2.png[mq-exchange-details2]

NOTE: If you need to delete an exchange, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq#how-do-i-delete-an-exchange[How do I delete an exchange?]

=== Bind a Queue to an Exchange

To bind a queue to an exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the left side of the exchange entry in Destinations.
+
*Note*: Where you click on an exchange entry in the Destinations table governs
what you see next:
+
image:mq-where-to-click-x2.png[mq-where-to-click-x2]
+
. In the Exchange menu, click *Bind* for each queue you want to bind to the exchange:
+
image:mq-bind-queue-to-exchange2.png[mq-bind-queue-to-exchange2]

=== Send a Message to an Exchange

Sending a message to an exchange is very similar to sending a message to a queue.
The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to an exchange.

To send a message to an exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the `MyDemoExchange` entry in Destinations to view details about
the exchange.
. Click the *MyDemoExchange* link in the details screen to access the Message Sender:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-access2.png[mq-exchange-msg-access2]
+
. Click *Message Sender*:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-sender2.png[mq-exchange-msg-sender2]
+
. Type the contents of the *Payload* and click *Send*:
+
image:mq-exchange-payload2.png[mq-exchange-payload2]

You can now use the Message Browser to get the message from the MyDemoQueue as described
in <<Get a Message From a Queue>>.

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message *Type* value. For more information, see <<Send a CSV or JSON Message>>.
