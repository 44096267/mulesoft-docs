== Anypoint MQ Workflow

To install and configure MQ:

. Register as an MQ customer using your Enterprise Mule credentials. This enables you to access MQ from Anypoint Platform.
. Log into Anypoint Platform and click the Gear icon in the top taskbar.
. Provide user access to Anypoint MQ features.
. Create a client application.
. Create one or more queues, and/or an exchange.
. In Anypoint Studio, install the MQ connector and create a Mule application with the MQ connector, set payload, and a logger.
. Run the Mule application.
. Set the MQ connector to publish, consume, ack, or nack a message to the queue. If you created an exchange, you only publish to the exchange.
. Use a program such as Postman to send or consume a message.
. Monitor the results of accessing the queue or exchange in the Studio console.
