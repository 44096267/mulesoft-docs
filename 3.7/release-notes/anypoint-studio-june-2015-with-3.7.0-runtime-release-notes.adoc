== New Features and Functionality

=== DataWeave Language and Transformer

This release introduces a new language, called DataWeave, which is a simple, powerful way to query and transform data inside of Mule. It provides JSON-like language that's purposefully built to make writing transformations as fast as possible and highly maintainable over the long term. It supports a variety of transformations, from simple 1 to 1 mappings, to more elaborate mappings including normalization, grouping, joins, partitioning, pivoting and filtering. 

The language is tightly integrated with Mule ESB and Anypoint Studio. There is a DataWeave Transformer that allows you to use the language to query and transform data. It fully supports DataSense, allowing you to leverage metadata from connectors, schemas and sample documents to more easily design your transformations. DataSense provides content assist while you are coding and scaffolds your mappings to help make writing transformations fast and easy. The editor also provides real time feedback as you code, processing sample inputs into sample outputs that are constantly updated as you write your transform.

DataWeave will replace our current DataMapper component as our recommended way of doing data transformation. It comes with a number of advantages over DataMapper, including:

* Support for more complex transformations
* Improved performance
* Better error reporting
* Support for multiple inputs and outputs
* Support for larger than memory payloads
* Random access to input documents

Currently there are some features of DataMapper that DataWeave does not yet support and which will be addressed in future releases, including:

* A graphical drag and drop editor for creating DataWeave transforms 
* Excel and fixed width formats

DataMapper will continue to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule ESB 3.x. 

=== Additional Improvements

* You can now supply design time metadata to message processors and declare the type of your payload, ensuring that Studio can provide you content-assist capabilities and that you have visibility into your payload everywhere. 

* When adding dependencies for connectors, you can now directly search the Maven repository to find the appropriate dependency and Studio will automatically add it to your POM.

* Support for Mule 3.7, including:

** NTLM authentication for the HTTP request configuration
** Preemptive authentication for HTTP
** Set payload, set variable, and set record variable message processors support for setting the mime type.
** WS-Consumer support for signing and encrypting payloads with WS-Security
** Support for the new 'non-blocking' process strategy
** Support for specifying the default processing strategy

* The underlying Eclipse runtime was upgraded to 4.4.2

== Migration Guide

This section presents configuration considerations you may want to adjust when migrating from a previous version of a Mule runtime, or previous version of Studio. mailto:support@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] if you have a question about a specific migration activity or concern.

* Mule ESB 3.7.0 is supported from Anypoint Studio June 2015 Release and onwards. Older Mule ESB runtimes can also be installed in the new Anypoint Studio release.
* APIkit 1.5.1 only works in runtimes whose versions are less than 3.6.0. APIkit 1.6.0 works in the 3.6.0 runtime and above (see https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/STUDIO-5955[JIRA STUDIO-5955]).
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java 7 ] is required for Anypoint Studio. If you are deploying to Java 6 runtimes, you can continue to configure Java 6 as the Java runtime for your project.

If you wish to install a previous runtime or a community runtime, follow the instructions to https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Adding+Community+Runtime[add additional runtimes] to your new instance of Studio.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

The 3.7.0 release does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by the 3.6.1 Runtime.

MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4 GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM. Please contact MuleSoft with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Deprecated in this Release

DataMapper is deprecated and superceded by https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/EARLYACCESS/Using+DataWeave+in+Studio[DataWeave]. DataMapper will continue to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule ESB 3.x, however it will be removed in Mule 4.0. We recommend that if customers wish to take advantage of the new capabilities of DataWeave or if they start new projects, they upgrade now. However, if you have no pressing need to take advantage of new functionality, we recommend you wait until Mule 4.0 is released.

If you want to deploy a Mule project that containst a DataMapper transformer in it, consider the following:

* When deploying through Anypoint Studio, it should still work normally
* When deploying to CloudHub, it should also work out of the box
* However, when deploying to Mule ESB Standalone 3.7.0-RC, you will need to download and add a https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/EARLYACCESS/Including+the+DataMapper+Plugin[DataMapper plugin] for it to work
