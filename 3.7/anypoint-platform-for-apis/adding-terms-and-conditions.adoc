= Adding Terms and Conditions

You can add a set of terms and conditions for users that consume your APIs. These will be applied to all of the APIs your account manages, and users will be prompted to accept them when subscribing to your services.

In order to add these terms and conditions, go to your API administration page, click in the menu icon on the top-right and then **Add terms & conditions**.

Enter your terms and conditions in plain text, click *Save* when you're done.

Once you have saved a set of terms of conditions, these will be automatically applied to all the APIs in your organization, no further steps are required.

[NOTE]
If you apply these settings at the Master Organization level, these terms and conditions will be used in the APIs of every one of your sub-organizations. If you apply this within the API Administration page of an individual sub-organization, the terms and conditions you set up will override the ones defined at a higher level and affect only the APIs of that sub-organization.

Users that access your API's portal and click on the Request Access button to subscribe will be prompted to accept these terms and conditions.

[NOTE]
Once they do, the current text of the terms and conditions will be recorded on the user's profile. This ensures that, in case these terms and conditions change, the user's contract remains as what he agreed to.
