= EDI X12 Order Processing Example

This example shows how to process an X12 850 document, export data to a CSV file, and generate a 997 acknowledgement using the File endpoint, link:/docs/display/current/X12+Module[X12 Module], link:/docs/display/current/Batch+Processing[Batch Processing] module, and link:/docs/display/35X/Datamapper+User+Guide+and+Reference[DataMapper]. 

== Prerequisites

Before going further, you need to have Anypoint Studio installed, the EDI Module installed in Anypoint Studio, and be familiar with the basic concepts of Mule applications.

== Concepts

The example application is comprised of 2 flows and 1 batch process. These do the following:

* ReceiveOrdersFromPartner: reads in an EDI file, validates it, send it off for processing and triggers sending of the acknowledgement
* Process850s: This batch job processes each record and outputs them to a CSV file with the item id, quantity and price.
* SendAck: Send a 997 acknowelgement generated from the first flow.
