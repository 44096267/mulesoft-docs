= Getting Started with CloudHub

CloudHub is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS). With the Anypoint Management Center, it allows you to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications both in the cloud and to servers and groups of servers on premises, create new APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premises applications with cloud services, manage servers and server groups on premises, and much more. With Anypoint Studio – the user-friendly development tool – you can quickly build integration applications and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks. This guide helps you learn the basics, and get started developing your first application.
