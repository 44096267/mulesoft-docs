= Alerts and Notifications
:keywords: cloudhub, management, analytics

== Overview

*Notifications* are standard messages that appear in the CloudHub console to provide status information about your applications. 

*Alerts* give you the ability to trigger emails whenever certain events related to your application occur.

CloudHub includes several out of the box *standard* *alert* types:

* You exceed a certain number of events processed in a certain time period
* A deployment completes with success or failure
* The secure data gateway gets connected or disconnected
* CloudHub encounters a problem with the worker on an application via the link:#[worker monitoring] system

Creating a standard alert creates both a notification in the console and an alert action, such as email to a specific user.

CloudHub also lets you create your own *custom* *alerts* for your application. Custom alerts are triggered by notifications that your application sends to the CloudHub console (using the http://mulesoft.github.io/cloudhub-connector[CloudHub Connector]). For example, you can send a custom alert when:

* Your application is unable to connect to a remote service
* An error occurs which requires human intervention, such as a problem with data mapping
* You want to create a summary of what occurred inside your application, such as the number of orders processed

Custom alerts differ from standard alerts in that you will receive a notification from your application inside the console UI regardless of whether you configure an alert.

== Managing Notifications

Notifications appear by clicking the bell icon in the top-right of the CloudHub console. When you have new notifications, the bell turns red.

Each notification has a priority level and a message associated with it. If the notification is associated with a specific application, the application name is also provided.
