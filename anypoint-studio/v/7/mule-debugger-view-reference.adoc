= Mule Debuger View Reference

// COMBAK: Update with new Site when available
This section contains a full description of the Mule Debugger View and all its available tools.

When a message arrives at the first breakpoint, the Mule Debugger View displays the Mule Event content:



To resume execution, click the *Resume* icon (see below) or press `F8`. Your application runs until the message reaches the next breakpoint, if any.

Rather than simply resuming execution, you can choose to go to the next message processor, skip to a selected message processor, or stop the application. See <<Execution Control Tools>> for full details.
