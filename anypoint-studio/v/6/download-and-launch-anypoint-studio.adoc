:keywords: download, studio, server, test, deploy, applications

*Anypoint Studio* is the graphical integration design environment of the Anypoint Plaform for applications that are deployed to Mule runtime.

For details on installing the Mule standalone runtime, the Mule Management Console, and Mule's Community runtime, refer to the comprehensive link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing[installation instructions] and to link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/setting-up-your-development-environment[Setting Up Your Development Environment].

[IMPORTANT]
====

* Before downloading and launching Anypoint Studio, install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java SE JDK 7] or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java SE JDK 8].

* If you are using a Mac computer running OS X and if you are installing Anypoint Studio on a new computer or a fresh installation, you must also install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JRE 1.6], which provides important libraries used by later JDK versions. Install JDK 6 first and then install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[JDK 7] or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java SE JDK 8].

After installing JDK 7 or 8, you need to change the default Java virtual machine (JVM) from v6 to the later version.

** Open a Terminal and enter this command as shown in the following example:

[source,code,linenums]
----
/usr/libexec/java_home -V
Matching Java Virtual Machines (2):
1.8.0_101, x86_64:	"Java SE 8"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_101.jdk/Contents/Home
1.6.0_65-b14-468, x86_64:	"Java SE 6"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
----

** Enter a command such as this that sets the JDK 8 to the default JVM.

[source]
----
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8.0_101`

*OS X*: If you're using OS version Sierra, it's important that you move your extracted app to the `/applications` folder before you launch it

*Linux*: To support some of Studio Themes in Linux, it is recommended to have GTK version 2 installed.

.. *Windows*: This message appears when you start Studio:
Incompatible JVM - Version _<number>_ of the JVM is not suitable for this product. Version 1.7 or greater is required.
Go to link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[Java SE JDK 7] or  or link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java SE JDK 8], download the JDK, and install it.

== Installing Enterprise Modules

If you are running *Anypoint Studio* with *Mule Enterprise Edition (EE)*, you can add additional modules to your Studio instance.

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing-anypoint-enterprise-security[Anypoint Enterprise Security] 

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] 

* mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] to acquire entitlements to access the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mulesoft-enterprise-java-connector-for-sap-reference[SAP Connector] and/or link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-high-availability-ha-clusters[High Availability Clustering]

== Updating Studio

Anypoint Studio notifies you when an update is available.

[TIP]
You can also check this manually going to *Help* > *Check for Updates*.

Keep in mind that updating your Studio installation to the latest release using this method does not update the bundled Runtime version that's announced in the link:/release-notes/anypoint-studio[release notes].

If you updated Studio from the update site and want to get the announced runtime version bundled with your version of Studio follow these steps:

. Go to *Help* > *Install New Software ...*.
. In the _Work with_ drop down menu select *Anypoint Studio Update Site*.
. Expand the *Anypoint Studio* entry.
. Select the *Mule Server Runtime {version}* that appears listed.
. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the installation.
