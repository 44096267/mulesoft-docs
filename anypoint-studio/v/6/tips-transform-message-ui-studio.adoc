= Tips for the Transform Message UI (Anypoint Studio)

First configure everything else on the flow.

Select an element in the output pane to have its corresponding line in the DataWeave code highlighted.

If an input field is mapped to two or more output fields, you can right-click it and then select which of the multiple outputs you want to highlight in the DataWeave code.

Filter the views displayed in the input and output structures by typing a name in the search boxes at the top of either, only those fields that match your search are then displayed.
