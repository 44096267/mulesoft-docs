= Tips for the Transform Message UI (Anypoint Studio)



* Before creating your mapping, configure everything else on the flow so that the input and output is known.


* Select an element in the output pane to have its corresponding line in the DataWeave code highlighted.

* If an input field is mapped to two or more output fields, you can right-click it and then select which of the multiple outputs you want to highlight in the DataWeave code.

* You can filter what you see from the input and output structures by typing a name in the search boxes at the top of either.
