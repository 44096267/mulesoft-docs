= AS2 Connector

The AS2 Connector allows you to send and receive data from AS2 certified servers.

== Introduction

After reading this page you should be able to accomplish the following:

* Install the AS2 Connector.
* Build a simple Hello World project.
* Run the example project.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule, the http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Studio+Essentials[Anypoint Studio interface] , and http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Global+Elements[Global Elements] . Further, it is assumed that you are familiar with AS2 endpoints and have received endpoint configuration requirements.

=== Namespace & Schema Location

The XML namespace and schema location are as follows:

[cols="",]
|===
a|
xmlns:as2="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/as2"

http://xsischemaLocation=[xsi:schemaLocation=]"

...

http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/as2 http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/as2/current/mule-as2.xsd"

|===

=== Requirements

* Mule 3.5.1, 3.5.2 or 3.6.0 Runtime
* Anypoint Studio October 2014 onwards
* JCE unlimited strength jurisdiction policy

== Installation

=== Installing the AS2 Connector in Anypoint Studio

Follow the steps below to install the AS2 Connector in Anypoint Studio. To use the AS2 Connector connector in a production environment, you must have purchased a license for Anypoint B2B.

. Under the *Help* menu in *Anypoint Studio*, select *Install New Software*. 
. Select the Anypoint Connectors Update Site
. In the table below the *Filter* field, click to expand the *Premium* folder, then select `AS2 Connector`. Click *Next*.  +

+

. Review the details of the item you selected, then click *Next*.
. Click to accept terms and conditions of the product, then click *Finish*.
. Click *Restart Now* to complete the installation. After you install the connector and restart Studio you can see several new message processors available in the palette, under the Connectors category.

=== Using the AS2 Module via Maven

If you wish to use the EDI Module in conjunction with Maven, please follow the instructions http://modusintegration.github.io/mule-connector-as2/guide/install.html[here].

== Using This Connector

=== Use Cases

* Send an AS2 Message
* Receive an AS2 Message
* Signed and/or encrypted and/or compressed AS2 messages
* Signed or unsigned receipts
* Synchronous or asynchronous receipts
* HTTP/HTTPS support

=== Tips

* Pick unique AS2 ID’s per connector instance, it will help you track your messages
* Test your trading partner ports and your own are open and reachable
* It is recommended to use port 80 and 443 when possible (avoids mapping firewall rules for each partner)
* When creating certificates, include it’s expiration date and your AS2 ID in the filename.

=== Adding to a Flow

Using the AS2 Connector in your application is explained in detail in the Example Use Case section below.

=== Increasing Performance

The AS2 connector supports compression on the AS2 Message payload which might mitigate performance issues for so called very large messages .

Example Use Case - Hello World

The following example requires basic familiarity with AS2, Anypoint Studio, and Mule ESB.

=== Receive AS2 messages without an agreement

==== Step 1

Create a new Mule Project using as run-time Mule Server 3.5.1 EE:

image:1+new+project.png[1+new+project]

==== Step 2

Locate the AS2 Connector on the right hand-side palette:

image:2+locate+as2.png[2+locate+as2]

==== Step 3

Drag the connector over to the canvas:

image:3+drag+to+canvas.png[3+drag+to+canvas]

==== Step 4

The connector requires an AS2 Connector Configuration . To create a connector configuration, you must first create a global HTTP endpoint and then bind the connector configuration to the endpoint. The connector’s operations leverage the HTTP endpoint to receive and send AS2 messages.

Click on the Global Elements tab and create an HTTP endpoint:

image:4+http+global.png[4+http+global]

==== Step 5

Set the HTTP endpoint name to the more descriptive name of “receive-as2-http-endpoint”. Click on the Connector Configuration add symbol to bring up the HTTP connector configuration dialog:

image:5+configure+http.png[5+configure+http]

==== Step 6

Set the HTTP connector name to the more descriptive name of “as2-http-connector” and press OK to go back to the global HTTP endpoint dialog box:

image:6+as2+http.png[6+as2+http]

==== Step 7

Press OK to close the global HTTP endpoint dialog box:

image:7+endpoint.png[7+endpoint]

==== Step 8

In this step, you will make an AS2 connector configuration and bind it to the global HTTP endpoint. From the Global Elements tab, create an AS2 Connector Configuration :

image:8+as2+global.png[8+as2+global]

==== Step 9

Type “receive-as2-http-endpoint” in the attribute Global HTTP Endpoint Reference to bind the AS2 connector to the previously created global HTTP endpoint. Press OK .

image:9+as2+endpoint.png[9+as2+endpoint]

==== Step 10

After completing the previous steps, you should have the following in the Global Elements tab:

image:10+global+elements.png[10+global+elements]

Back to the Message Flow tab, on the AS2 processor, select “AS2” from the Connector Configuration drop-down list and select “Receive” from the Operation drop-down list:

image:11+as2+on+canvas.png[11+as2+on+canvas]

==== Step 11

The connector’s Key Store Path attribute must be configured in either of the following scenarios:

. Connector receives a signed request,
. Connector receives an encrypted request
. Sender requests a signed receipt

The key store must be in PKCS #12 or JKS format. For scenario 1, the key store has to contain the certificate used by the AS2 connector to verify the request’s authenticity. Scenario 2 and 3 require the key store to have a dual-purpose public/private key pair that the connector uses to decrypt the request and sign the receipt. The key store entry alias name for the certificate is required to match the AS2-From field received in the request’s headers. Similarly, the key store entry alias name for the public/private key pair is required to match the AS2-To field received in the request’s headers. The attribute Key Store Password must be set if the key store is protected by a password.

A cross-platform tool that can help you with the setting up of PKCS #12 key stores is http://keystore-explorer.sourceforge.net/[KeyStore Explorer] .

IMPORTANT: For CloudHub deployments, key stores must be located within the Mule application Java classpath (e.g., “src/main/resources”). Furthermore, the key store path attribute has to be relative to the classpath. For instance, if the key store is located at “src/main/resources/key-stores/my-key-store.p12”, then Key Store Path is set to “key-stores/my-key-store.p12”.

==== Step 12

Add a File outbound endpoint to save the sender’s AS2 request content. Drag a File outbound endpoint from the palette next to the AS2 Connector. Set the Path attribute to “outbox” and Output Pattern to “data.txt”:

image:12+file.png[12+file]

==== Step 13

Finally, run the example as a Mule application:

image:13+run+as+mule+app.png[13+run+as+mule+app]

The connector will save the content of valid AS2 requests in the file “data.txt” inside the project root directory “outbox”.
