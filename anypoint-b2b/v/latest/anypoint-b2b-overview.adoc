= Anypoint B2B Overview
:keywords: b2b, introduction, portal, partner, manager

Anypoint B2B provides an integrated set of components to simplify the configuration and tracking required for implementing typical B2B integrations in the Anypoint platform.

== Architecture

While the Anypoint B2B core services are hosted in Mulesoft's cloud, the Mule flows and connectors that interact with them may be run in CloudHub or on-premises.
The following diagrams show how these services work together in the context of <<cloudhub, Cloudhub>> or a <<on-premises, Mule (on-premises) application>>.

== Anypoint Partner Manager

Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) provides a single user interface for viewing and configuring <<Trading Partner Management>> settings and B2B <<Message Tracking>> data.

=== Trading Partner Management

The Trading Partner Management (TPM) service provides the ability to edit, store and retrieve configuration settings for the transport and format of B2B messages. For example, EDI messages are often sent over the AS2 protocol in order to ensure security and integrity of the transmissions. Each trading partner may have AS2 different settings. In addition, different partners may use different format protocols such as EDI X12, EDIFACT, or XML; they may also use different options within those protocols. The TPM service allows this configuration data to be managed outside of your Mule applications, so that they can be reviewed without looking at the code and updated without re-deploying your Mule flows.

To use APM to configure settings for a B2B flow, complete the steps that follow.

==== In Anypoint Partner Manager

* Set up the home organization
* Set up an external trading partner

==== In AnyPoint Studio

* Build your flow
* Configure the B2B Connector
* Configure B2B-enabled Connectors to use the B2B Connector
* Complete the flow
* Use standard MuleSoft connectors and processors to complete the processing and integration of the message into downstream systems as required.

=== Message Tracking

Because B2B messages often communicate contractual obligations between companies, it is desirable (and sometimes necessary) to track all messages sent or received, storing the actual message content as well as metadata (such as data and time the message was sent or received, the identity of the partner, and success or failure of processing). The Anypoint B2B Message Tracking service provides a simple, secure, and integrated mechanism for message tracking within Mulesoft flows. This data can be used for non-repudiation, error correction, and auditing.

Currently the tracking metadata is stored in a database in CloudHub and the actual message content is saved to an S3 bucket provided by the customer.

=== B2B Connector

The B2B Connector coordinates the saving and retrieval of TPM and Tracking data within the Mule Runtime. B2B-enabled connectors communicate with the B2B Connector to request TPM data and to submit tracking data. The B2B Connector handles local caching as well as communication with the TPM and Tracking APIs.

=== B2B-enabled Connectors

The AS2, FTPS, X12,and EDIFACT connectors and modules are written to integrate with the Anypoint B2B core services for runtime retrieval of configuration data and for message tracking. The only setup required is to make sure the B2B Connector module is configured with your API Key and to check the *Use B2B Provider* checkbox in the configuration screen of any B2B-enabled connector. Once this is set up, the B2B Connector ensures that the configuration data for this connector is pulled at runtime from the TPM data and that tracking data are stored to the Anypoint B2B Message Tracking service.

=== Non-B2B-enabled Connectors

For connectors that are not written to integrate with Anypoint B2B, the B2B Connector can be used to store data to Message Tracking. The developer can include the B2B Connector in the flow and determine the data that is sent to the message tracking system.
