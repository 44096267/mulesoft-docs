:keywords: b2b, edi, portal

Anypoint B2B provides an integrated set of components to simplify the configuration and tracking required to implement typical B2B integrations in the Anypoint platform.

Anypoint B2B enables Mule users to connect with trading partners using EDI over AS2, FTP, and other protocols. Anypoint B2B integrates seamlessly into the Mule runtime.

== About this Page

This page introduces Anypoint B2B and links to pages that provide Anypoint B2B implementation examples in the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule’s graphical user interface. In addition, we provide configuration details for implementing Anypoint B2B in Anypoint Studio's XML Editor.

== Architecture

While the Anypoint B2B core services are hosted in MuleSoft's cloud, the Mule flows and connectors that interact with them may be run in Runtime Manager or on-premises.
The following diagrams show how these services work together in the context of Runtime Manager or Mule (on-premises) application.

== Components

=== Anypoint Partner Manager

link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager[Anypoint Partner Manager] (APM) provides a single user interface for viewing and configuring Trading Partner Management settings and B2B Message Tracking data.

=== Partner Manager Connector

The Partner Manager Connector coordinates saving and retrieval of TPM and Tracking data within the Mule Runtime. B2B-enabled connectors communicate with the Partner Manager Connector to request TPM data and to submit tracking data. The Partner Manager Connector handles local caching as well as communication with the TPM and Tracking APIs.

=== Partner Manager-enabled Connectors

The link:/anypoint-b2b/as2-connector[AS2], link:/anypoint-b2b/ftps-connector[FTPS], * link:/anypoint-b2b/x12-module[X12], and link:/anypoint-b2b/edifact-module[EDIFACT] connectors and modules are written to integrate with the Anypoint B2B core services for runtime retrieval of configuration data and for message tracking. The only setup required is to make sure the Partner Manager Connector module is configured with your API Key and to check the *Use B2B Provider* checkbox in the configuration screen of any B2B-enabled connector. Once this is set up, the Partner Manager Connector ensures that the configuration data for this connector is pulled at runtime from the TPM data and that tracking data are stored to the Anypoint B2B Message Tracking service.

=== Non-Partner Manager-enabled Connectors

For connectors that are not written to integrate with Anypoint B2B, the Partner Manager Connector can be used to store data to Message Tracking. You can include the Partner Manager Connector in your flow and determine the data that is sent to the message tracking system.
