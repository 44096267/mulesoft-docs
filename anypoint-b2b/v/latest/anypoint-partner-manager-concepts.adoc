== B2B Transaction-Processing Framework

A B2B Transaction Processing solution serves as a translation layer between internal systems and the various formats (X12, EDIFACT, XML, CSV, and others) and transport protocols (AS2, FTP/S, and others) commonly used in electronic transactions between companies.  Because a company typically cannot dictate that all its trading partners comply with a single configuration, it often becomes necessary to develop individualized solutions for each trading partner. If custom software development is required for each trading partner, this greatly increases the effort and time of onboarding new trading partners, limiting the business relationships a company can pursue.

B2B Transaction Processing Framework enables developers to build a single set of Mule ESB flows that can process a wide range of messages from many different partners by dynamically applying rules and configuration data stored in Partner Manager. This allows non-programmers such as data analysts to onboard new trading partner relationships and support new transaction types using the Partner Manager website without the need to develop, test, and deploy new Mule ESB flows. This section identifies the high-level framework components and delineates their roles in end-to-end B2B transaction processing.

=== Functional Architecture

B2B transaction processing typically proceeds through some combination of the following stages. (The exact processing stages used and the order can vary between companies.)

image:1-functional-architecture.png[1-functional-architecture.png]

==== Receive

Each incoming transaction from a partner or internal system is delivered through a transport protocol endpoint configured to receive the message.

==== Resolve
Using data that may be inside the message or in incoming metadata (such as http headers or filenames), this stage identifies the partner and the transaction type, then uses these to look up associated processing details from Partner Manager. These details include:

* Schema to use for validation
* Map to transform the message into the required target format
* Endpoint to which the transformed message is to be delivered

==== Transform

Each incoming message is translated into the canonical message format for the target service being invoked. This translation is performed dynamically using a map retrieved from the Trading Partner Management (TPM) API.

==== Validate
Makes sure the required data is present in the required format. This validation is performed dynamically using a schema retrieved from the Trading Partner Management (TPM) API.

==== deliver
Using endpoint configuration data retrieved from the Trading Partner Management (TPM) API the flow dynamically delivers the message to the Business Service endpoint address.

=== Technical Architecture
The following diagram shows the primary components of the framework and how these components interact to process B2B transactions.

image:2-b2b-message-processing-framework.png[2-b2b-message-processing-framework.png]

==== MuleSoft-provided Components

===== Anypoint Partner Manager website
The Anypoint Partner Manager website is the user interface for configuring how B2B transactions are processed and for monitoring and managing processed transactions.

===== Trading Partner Management (TPM) API
The TPM API manages storage and retrieval of configuration data for partners, including the details for processing their transactions.

===== Tracking API
The Tracking API manages storage and retrieval of metadata about processed transactions: for example, Sender, Receiver, time stamps, message type, and acknowledgement status. This includes but is not limited to correlation logic for matching acknowledgements to original messages and identifying duplicate messages.

===== Partner Manager Connector
The Partner Manager Connector (PMC) is a component that runs inside of Mule ESB and coordinates all interaction with the Partner Manager APIs (TPM and Tracking).

===== Object Store
The Object Store is a distributed cache in Mule ESB that replicates data across nodes in a cluster. TPM configuration data, once retrieved, is cached in the Object Store to minimize calls to the TPM Service to improve performance and reliability. The PMC manages this caching.
==== Customer-built components
Note: At this time the various flows listed below must be developed by the customer. MuleSoft may provide these components as part of the product in the future. However, the option will remain for customers to provide their own implementations to provide full extensibility and customization.

===== Receive Flows
Each receive endpoint corresponds to a Mule flow that consists of the appropriate protocol connector and the appropriate endpoint configuration. After receiving a message over a particular protocol, each receive flow:

* Tracks the message using the Partner Manager Connector (PMC) in order to persist a copy of the message as it was received from the partner.
* Places a queue message with headers populated with any important metadata from the inbound protocol such as transport headers and filenames on the Resolve queue.

Activation of the receive flows is done dynamically by a Receive Endpoint listener flow which polls the TPM system for the list of Endpoints that should be active. This flow creates a specific endpoint for each flow based on a template for the required transport protocol. It then dynamically instantiates that flow into the Mule ESB runtime and starts it, so that the required connector endpoint is active and listening for messages.

===== Resolve Flow
The Resolve flow does the following:

* Pulls together from the message and any transport headers the needed metadata fields for identifying the specific Document Type.
* Passes the metadata fields to the TPM service to look up the Document Type and associated configuration settings (map, schema, target endpoint) and adds this information to the context headers that travel with the message to be used by later stages.
* Passes the message to the next processing stage.

===== Transform Flow
The Transform flow:

* Dynamically applies the configured mapping script from the context header to translate the message into the canonical format for the target Business Service.
* Does any necessary data translation, such as resolving partner values to your values using lookup tables, functions, and flows.
* Uses the PMC to track the mapped, canonical version of the message.
* Passes the updated message body to the next processing stage.

===== Validate Flow
The Validate flow:

* Dynamically applies the configured schema script to validate that the message is in the required format.
* Uses the PMC to track the validation result for the message.
* Passes the message to the next processing stage.

===== Deliver Flow
The Deliver Flow:

* Invokes the target service by passing the transformed message to the configured transport endpoint.
* Uses the PMC to track the result from the target service.

===== Message Payload Persistence Flow
The Message Payload Persistence Flow is an optional flow that can be implemented to store message payloads at various stages. It receives a MuleSoft message from the PMC, persists that message payload to the desired data store, and returns a URL that can be used to retrieve the message later using the Message Payload Retrieval Flow. The URL is stored in the related tracking data stored in the Tracking API in AnyPoint Partner Manager and displayed to the user in the context of the transaction. Clicking this link will invoke the Message Payload Retrieval Flow and display the message payload in a pop-up window.

===== Message Payload Retrieval API Flow
The Message Payload Retrieval API Flow is used to retrieve the message payload with a URL (which contains the specific transactionId of the message to be retrieved).

===== Business Service Flows
For each target internal service, there is typically a Mule ESB flow that exposes a REST-based API and communicates with the backend system using the appropriate connector or connectors. These Business Service flows are not technically part of the B2B system, but are often part of the overall solution.

===== Replay Flow
The replay flow coordinates replaying transactions. It polls the Tracking service for transactions that have been marked for replay. When it finds transactions that need to be replayed it:

. Pulls the original Message body and headers from the Tracking API and the Message Payload Retrieval API.
. Constructs a new Mule message with the original payload and headers and passes it to the Resolve flow to reprocess the transaction.
. Tracks the fact that the transaction has been replayed.
. Updates the TPM service to indicate that the replay is complete

=== Information Architecture: Partner Manager-configurable entities and terms
Anypoint Partner Manager stores the following configuration data in order to support the dynamic processing of different transaction types for different trading partners.

image:3-b2b-transaction.png[3-b2b-transaction.png]

==== Partner
Represents an external company with which your company does business. Your company itself is also considered a Partner.[3][4]

==== Partnership
Represents the relationship with an external company with which your company does business. Your company itself is also considered a Partner, and there is a special partnership called the “Home Org” in the Anypoint Partner Manager product.

==== Partner Identifier
A predefined identifier of a specific Partner. There are several types of Partner Identifiers used in B2B transactions and configurable in APM. For example, for EDI X12 documents there are ISA identifiers, which are used in EDI interchanges to identify the sender and receiver. AS2 is another type of identifier used in AS2 transmissions.

==== Document, Message, File
These different terms are used interchangeably and somewhat loosely in various B2B domains, to reflect an instance of a structured payload being passed through the system to convey information about a transaction. For consistency, the APM documentation uses the term Document to represent this concept.

==== Document Type
A specific message type that is configured in the system. A Document Type is identified by the following pieces of information:

* Standard - X12, EDIFACT, XML, CSV, JSON, etc.
* Version:
** X12 - 4010, 5010, etc.
** RosettaNet - PIP3B3v11.12.00
** for Standards that don’t have versions (XML, CSV, etc.) Version is empty
* Message Type
** X12 - 850, 855, 856, etc.
** RosettaNet - 3B3
** XML - root node name, namespace
** CSV, JSON - Name given to the transaction, not necessarily contained in the message

==== Document Properties
Document Properties are data fields that are extracted from received documents for the purpose of searching, correlation, TPM resolution, or duplicate checking. Document Properties are configured for Document Types. The user provides the Name of the property and the Path (XPath for XML, JSONPath for others) for retrieving the property from the document. These properties are extracted from the document by the Tracking API and stored to be used later for the purposes mentioned above.

==== Schema
The schema is stored with the Document Type. It is one of the following depending on the message type:

[%header,cols="3s,7a"]
|===
|Message Type
|Schema type

|XML
|XSD file
|CSV
|NA
|EDI
|EDI Schema Language (esl) file
|JSON
|Json Schema
|===

==== Map

Map script (XSLT or DataWeave) for transforming from one Document Type to another Document Type.

==== Source Channel
Details for how a particular Document is received. Received is used here relative to the B2B Transaction Processing flows. An inbound transaction would have a Source Channel that receives a Document from an external partner. An outbound transaction would have a Source Channel that receives a Document from an internal system.

==== Target Channel
Details for how a particular Document is delivered or sent out. Sent is used here relative to the B2B Transaction Processing flows. An inbound transaction would have a Target Channel that sends a Document to an internal system. An outbound transaction would have a Target Channel that sends a Document to an external partner.

==== Route
Connects a Source Channel to a Target Channel.

==== Transaction
Denotes the end-to-end processing of a single instance of a document from the receipt at an endpoint all the way to the desired destination. A TransactionId can be used to find metadata and persisted payloads for the transaction at each stage.

==== Inbound vs. Outbound Transaction
Inbound versus Outbound is always used to denote direction of documents being exchanged between partners. A document from an external partner to the home organization is considered Inbound. A document sent from the home organization to an external partner is considered Outbound.[5][6]
The following diagram depicts the relationship between these configuration entities relative to the processing of inbound or outbound transactions:

image:4-inbound-outbound.png[4-inbound-outbound.png]

Note that in order to be flexible enough to support the range of possible usage scenarios, this information architecture supports configuration options that are not all needed in every scenario.

For example, a common pattern for inbound transactions is to map an incoming Document into a standard internal format, often called the “canonical” format. If the target system accepts this canonical format, there is no need to apply two maps. A map can be configured for the Source Channel to transform into the canonical format, and there is no map needed for the Target Channel. However, if there are multiple Target Channels for a given Source Channel, there may be a need to apply an additional map in one of the Target Channels, so in that case two different maps would be applied.

For an Outbound transaction, the document might originate in the canonical format and so there may not be a map required in the Source Channel, but there would be one in the Target Channel to map to the desired format of the external partner.

=== User Interface

The Anypoint Partner Manager user interface enables configuration of:

* B2B Transactions
* Partners
* Channels
* Documents
* Document Properties
* Endpoints
* Maps
* Routes

==== Transaction Monitoring

* Search and view results of processed transactions.
* View end-to-end processing that occurred for a transaction.
* Manually cause the replay of failed transactions.


== Resolution Processes

APM offers a flexible approach to setting up different kinds of configurations
for document definitions, endpoints, and routes. For example, you can configure
a catch-all document definition for a given standard. You can then apply this
definition to your trading partner in case
a document does not match any of the defined document definitions. Going
even further, you can configure a global catch-all for this standard such that it
is applied to all your partners. In order to support this level of flexibility,
configurations are defined at the partner or the home organization level.
APM attempts to resolve a configuration at the home organization level should
it fail to resolve it at the partner level. The next sub-sections  describe in
more detail the resolution process for each type of configuration.

=== Document Definition Resolution

As briefly mentioned above, you can configure a document definition to cover
different message types and versions. Leaving a document definitions's message
type and version undefined implicitly means that the document definition can be
applied to any document for the given standard. Alternatively, you can explicitly
set message type and version to the reserved keyword _ANY_ to attain the same
behavior. APM always tries first to match a document to the most specific
document definition before trying to match the document to a more general
document definition. What follows is a flowchart showing the
sequence of decisions APM goes through to arrive at the document
definition to use during route resolution or tracking.

image:resolve-document-definition.png[Document definition resolution flowchart]

APM comes with pre-configured read-only document definitions for X12 and EDIFACT
that are defined on the home organization. An X12 or EDIFACT document that is not
covered by any user-defined document definition *always* matches to one of
these pre-defined document definitions.

=== Endpoint Resolution

Endpoint resolution kicks in when an APM managed connector pulls down its
configuration from APM. The resolution outputs the endpoint that the connector
reads to configure itself. The following factors drive the resolution process:

* Partner
* Endpoint type, that is, send or receive
* Transport type such as AS2
* Document's standard such as X12
* Document's version
* Document's message type

The resolution process for endpoints is shown in the next flowchart:

image:resolve-endpoint.png[Endpoint resolution flowchart]

=== Routes Resolution

Calling Partner Manager Connector's _resolve-route_ operation triggers routes
resolution in APM which, similar to endpoint resolution, is driven by the subsequent
factors:

* Partner
* Transport type such as AS2
* Document's standard such as X12
* Document's version
* Document's message type

After taking a closer look, notice that the endpoint type is not included in
the list of factors determining the output of routes. The is because the process
assumes the endpoint to be always of type receive. The following flowchart
describes APM's logic for resolving routes:

image:resolve-routes.png[Routes resolution flowchart]

== Tracking

This section identifies scenarios in which Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) is useful to track B2B exchanges. A basic knowledge of APM is assumed; see  link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager[Anypoint Partner Manager] for more information. For specific information about how to implement APM, see link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager-users-guide[Anypoint Partner Manager User's Guide].

=== Scenarios

==== Replaying an Incomplete Transaction

On the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[B2B Transactions Page], the Transactions View includes a table in which each row corresponds to a transaction.  The first column shows transaction completion status, as follows:

Green checkmark:: Indicates a complete transaction.
Red exclamation point (*!*):: Indicates a transaction has one or more errors that prevented completion.

After you identify and fix the cause of the error that prevented the transaction from completing, you can use APM to re-run the transaction.

Possible errors include:

* Server down
* Dependency (for example, a map or code element) has changed
* Required data is absent

NOTE: Only replay transactions after resolving the issue or issues that caused the error.

For more information, see "Transactions View" in link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[Monitor B2B Transactions].

===== To Replay a Transaction

. Click the row corresponding to the transaction you want to replay.
+
NOTE: For a transaction to be replayable, the second (Replay Status) column must be blank or contain a gray partial circle, but must not contain a blue partial circle.
+
A blue *Replay* button appears in the Top Bar.
+
. Click the blue *Replay* button
+
The button becomes unclickable, and a message that the transaction is being replayed appears in its place.
+
Once the transaction has been replayed, the blue replay circle appears in the Replay Status Column of the transaction that you replayed.
+
. To see if the replayed transaction succeeded or failed, click the replayed transaction.
+
. In the Transaction Detail Pane, a link to *view replays* appears.
+
This automatically filters the grid by *Transaction ID*, so that only transactions that are replays of the original transaction appear.
+
If the replayed transaction fails again, repeat this process until the replay completes.
+
You can always view a list of all of transactions that have been replayed from a given original transaction by clicking the link in the Transaction Detail Pane of any transaction for which the blue replay circle appears in the Replay Status Column.
+
Once the replay succeeds, a green check appears next to the replayed transaction.
If you need to continue replaying the transaction, you can do so with the same replay button as before, but you will be alerted with a warning before you can continue. This is to prevent unnecessary replays from happening.

==== Common Errors

If you see an atypical number of errors of a similar nature, you can review all of them simultaneously.

The *Dashboard* at the top of the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[Monitor B2B Transactions] provides a summary of what has happened in a given timeframe (the default is the current day) including how many errors have been detected during that timeframe.

===== To View Error Information in the Dashboard

. Hover over different slices of the Errors Pie Chart to see what types of errors have occurred.
. To see information for a given error type, click one of the slices.
+
The Error View appears, showing only the error type over which you were hovering.
+
This enables you to look for a pattern among these errors that will facilitate a solution to the errors. This is useful when transactions are failing. but you can't ascertain the solution by just looking at the transactions themselves.
+
The navigation buttons at top right enable you to view the transactions with which these errors are associated.

==== Transport Problem Identification

If you notice that you are getting a large number of errors from a single type of transport, you can sort your transmissions using a filter in combination with the Transmissions View on the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[Monitor B2B Transactions]. The filter allows you to view a given transport type and see the differences between those that failed and those that succeeded.

You can find additional relevant information in the Transmissions Detail Pane to the right. In the Detail Pane, you can see what happened with individual transactions with which transmissions were involved through a navigation button in the upper corner.

This allows you to follow transactions through their entire cycle, and if necessary replay them through the replay button.

Because consistent navigation is helpful in looking for patterns and correcting errors, many filters persist from view to view. This allows you to look for commonalities across data types.

==== When a Partner Needs Records

Often, a partner requires specific information relating to a transaction, transmission, or document. The following explains ways to access and use that information.

===== Finding Transmissions

. On *View Dropdown List* of the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[B2B Transactions Page], choose *Transmissions*.
+
The Transmissions View appears.
+
. In the *Transmission ID* filter, enter the partner ID.
+
The Transmissions Detail Pane populates with information that is likely relevant the partner's request.
+
. To copy a long string for partner use, click the *copy* button to the right of the string.
+
Additional relevant information can be found using the various filter and sort possibilities this view presents.
+
NOTE: You can always use the *Clear Filters* button to get back to the full view.
+
If you need to find out more information about a transmission or just where it exists in the larger scope you can click on the *Transaction* button in the upper right corner to view the transmission in context.

===== Finding Documents

. On *View Dropdown List* of the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[B2B Transactions Page], choose *Documents*.
+
The Documents View appears.
. In the *Document ID* filter, enter the Document ID that the partner provided you.
+
The Document Detail Pane populates with information that is likely relevant to the partner's request.
+
To copy a long string for partner use, click the *copy* button to the right of the string.
+
Additional relevant information can be found using the various filter and sort possibilities this view presents.
+
NOTE: You can always use the *Clear Filters* button to get back to the full view.
+
If you need to find out more information about a document, or to see where it fits into the bigger picture, you can click on the *Transaction* button in the upper right corner to view the document in context.
