[NOTE]
This page documents a Beta release of Anypoint Partner Manager (APM). For access to or for more information about APM, see your Mulesoft account representative.

Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) provides configuration and monitoring for AnyPoint B2B messaging flows. This page identifies the APM features you use to configure and monitor B2B configurations and messages.

// image:b2b_intro_03.png[b2b_intro_03]

To configure a trading partnership using APM, you must :

. <<Set up a home organization>>
. <<Set up a trading partner>>

== Set up a home organization

The _home organization_, or _home org_, is you - that is, the company licensing Anypoint B2B. To use  link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-b2b[Anypoint B2B], you must first create this home org in APM. You can configure the following:

* <<Contacts - Home org>>
* <<Transport - Home org>>
** <<AS2 Identity Settings - Home org>>
* <<Format - Home org>>
** <<X12 Identity Settings - Home org>>
** <<EDIFACT Identity Settings - Home org>>

=== Contacts - Home org

Company Name::
Enter the name for your home org

API Key::
Create an API key. The API Application Program Interface (API) Key is a 32-bit alphanumeric universal unique identifier (UUID) string that APM generates for you; you use it to access the Anypoint B2B API. Store your API key in a secure location. If you lose it, you will need to create a new API key. APM does not store your API key.

Contact type::
Use this field to add contacts for your Company. A contact may be technical, business, or both.

=== Transport - Home org

You can configure default options for B2B-enabled Home Org transport connectors; currently, this includes AS2.

==== AS2

AS2 is a secure transport protocol that enables files to be signed, encrypted and sent
between a company and its trading partners. You can configure both inbound and outbound settings.

==== AS2 Identity Settings - Home org

. In the *AS2 Identity* box, enter the name you want to use for your company's AS2 ID.
. Click *Choose File* to select and upload this trading partner’s AS2 Certificate.
+
The *Certificate Name*, *Expiration* and *Thumbprint* fields automatically populate when an AS2 certificate is uploaded.

=== Format - Home org

You can configure default options for supported B2B format standards (currently EDI X12 and EDIFACT).

==== X12

X12 standards define the structure, format, and content of business transactions conducted through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and are used in conjunction with AS2 or FTPS as transport for these transaction sets.

==== X12 Identity Settings - Home org

Interchange ID qualifier::
This is the qualifier your company will use as a default X12 Qualifier. If you have exceptions, you can change them at the transaction level for an individual trading partner.

Interchange ID (ISA)::
This is the X12 EDI identifier your company will be using as a default EDI ID. If you have exceptions, you can change them at the transaction level for the individual trading partner.


==== EDIFACT Identity Settings - Home org

Interchange ID Qualifier (UNB)::
Qualifier your company uses as a default EDIFACT Qualifier. If you have exceptions, you can change them at the transaction level for the individual trading partner.

Interchange ID (UNB)::

Enter your EDIFACT trading partner ID.

== Set up a trading partner

In order to exchange B2B messages with another company, you must create a _Trading Partner_ in APM. You can configure trading partner information for:

* <<Company - Partner>>
* <<Transport - Partner>>
** <<AS2 - Partner>>
** <<FTPS - Partner>>
* <<Format - Partner>>
** <<X12 - Partner>>
** <<EDIFACT - Partner>>
* <<Transactions - Partner>>

Description

* *7-bit*
+
Data that is all represented as relatively short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation sequences.
No bytes with decimal values greater than 127 are allowed and neither are NULLs (bytes with decimal value 0).
CR (decimal value 13) and LF (decimal value 10) bytes only occur as part of CRLF line separation sequences.

* *8-bit*
+
Data that is all represented as relatively
short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation
sequences, but bytes with decimal values greater than 127
may be used.  As with "7bit data" CR and LF bytes only occur as part
of CRLF line separation sequences and no NULLs are allowed.


* *Quoted-Printable*
+
Intended to represent data that largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in
the US-ASCII character set.  It encodes the data in such a way that
the resulting bytes are unlikely to be modified by mail transport.
If the data being encoded are mostly US-ASCII text, the encoded form
of the data remains largely recognizable by humans.  A body which is
entirely US-ASCII may also be encoded in Quoted-Printable to ensure
the integrity of the data should the message pass through a
character-translating, and/or line-wrapping gateway.

---

3DES is an encryption that uses 3 different “Keys”,or encryptions, to encrypt the messages.
No other choices are available at this time.

NOTE: If this checkbox is selected, the *Require Receipt for Unsupported Digest Algorithm* and *Require Receipt for Unsupported Signature Format* checkboxes appear.

====== MDN Signed
Ensures trading partner validation and security

====== MDN Async
Allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to the AS2 message sender's server at a later time.
Typically used when large files are involved, or when a trading partner's AS2 server has poor Internet service.
