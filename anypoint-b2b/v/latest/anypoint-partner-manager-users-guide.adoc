* Company Name that is displayed in the Portal

==== Contacts

In the contacts section you can configure the name that is displayed for the trading partner, and optionally technical and business contacts for the partner.

==== Transport settings

In the Transport Settings section you can configure the default options for any B2B-enabled transport connectors, currently AS2 and FTP/S.

==== Format Settings

In the Format Settings section you can configure the default options for supported B2B format standards, currently EDI X12 and EDIFACT.

==== Transactions

In the Transactions section you can configure specific transactions you expect to process with this trading partner. Transactions can be inbound or outbound and each is defined by a transport protocol and format protocol. For example, if you expect to receive X12 850 messages and to respond with X12 856 messages, you would set those transactions up as inbound and outbound respectively.

[NOTE]
In Beta 1, you are only required to set up transactions if you are using the FTP/S transport. Future versions of Anypoint B2B provide options to override the default partner settings in specific transactions, and to control which transactions can be exchanged with a specific trading partner.

== Monitoring B2B Transmissions

The Partner Manager also supports monitoring the tracking data for B2B Transmissions.
