= Modules Reference

Modules are similar to link:/documentation/display/current/Connecting+Using+Transports[transports] in that they provide pluggable functionality, configured via dedicated schema, but they differ in that there is no underlying transport to send or receive data. Following is a list of the default Mule ESB modules.
