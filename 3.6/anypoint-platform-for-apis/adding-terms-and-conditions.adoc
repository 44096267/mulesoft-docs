= Adding Terms and Conditions

You can add a set of terms and conditions for users that consume your APIs. These will be applied to all of the APIs your account manages, and users will be prompted to accept them when subscribing to your services.

In order to add these terms and conditions, go to your API administration page, click in the menu icon on the top-right and then **Add terms & conditions**.

Once you have saved a set of terms of conditions, these will be automatically applied to all your APIs, no further steps are required.

Users that access your API's portal and click on the Request Access button to subscribe will be prompted to accept these terms and conditions.

[NOTE]
Once they do, the current text of the terms and conditions will be recorded on the user's profile. This ensures that, in case these terms and conditions change, the user's contract remains as what he agreed to.
