= Getting Started with CloudHub
:keywords: cloudhub

CloudHub is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS). It allows you to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications, create new APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premise applications with cloud services, and much more. With Anypoint Studio – the user-friendly development tool – you can quickly build these integration applications and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks. This guide  helps you learn the basics and get started developing your first applications.
