= Managing Application Data Storage with Object Stores
:keywords: cloudhub, object stores

CloudHub includes application data storage for each CloudHub application which are accessible through Mule's link:/documentation/display/current/Mule+Object+Stores[ObjectStore] functionality. This storage can be used to store anything, but two of its main uses are:

* Storing synchronization state:  Your application may need to keep track of the last record synchronized, so the next time it synchronizes it can resume where it left off.
* OAuth tokens:  All our OAuth enabled connectors can store tokens inside our ObjectStore with a few lines of configuration.

Your application can also store any other custom integration data as well, within the limits outlined below.

== Storing and Retrieving Data

The easiest way to work with application data inside from your Mule flows is by using the http://mulesoft.github.com/mule-module-objectstore/mule/modules.html[Object Store module]. It provides functions to store, retrieve, list, and remove data from the CloudHub ObjectStore.

To install this Module into Anypoint Studio, link:/documentation/display/current/Installing+Extensions[follow these instructions] and select the Object Store module for installation.

=== Storing OAuth data

Each connector contains instructions on how to use the ObjectStore module to store and retrieve OAuth tokens. See the "Saving and Restoring State" section in the http://mulesoft.github.com/linkedin-connector/mule/linkedin-config.html#config[LinkedIn connector configuration] documentation for an example.

== Viewing Application Data

To view application data, click on the Application Data tab when viewing your application. You'll see a list of your keys and values listed. To search your keys, simply type the key name in the search bar.

== Semantics and Storage Limits

The CloudHub object store provides read-after-write consistency and the last write  wins in terms of updates. 

Additionally, it places these limits on your data:

. A maximum of 100,000 keys per application
. A 768 byte key size
. A 1 MB value size
. 1 GB of data per application

== Advanced Information

Internally, Mule has several different types of object stores. CloudHub provides an implementation of the user defined object store. This is for runtime information about your application, such as those use cases mentioned above. If you wish to access this object store directly, it can be found internally in the Mule Registry under the `_defaultUserObjectStore`. The Object Store module and connectors  use this store to store all their data by default.
