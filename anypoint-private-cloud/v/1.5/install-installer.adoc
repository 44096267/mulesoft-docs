= To Run the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Installer
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises


== Overview

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition offers all of the features that are available in the online version of the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] as a service that you can fully run on your local servers, guarded by any security policies you may require.

This document guides you through the installation process. After completing the steps in this document, you should have Anypoint Platform running on your own local network, with which you can deploy and manage applications, register APIs and use Exchange.



[NOTE]
====
Before you begin, make sure that you fulfill the link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/prereq-workflow[Prerequisites] for installing Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

The installer itself runs a few validations automatically for disk space, disk speed, network speed and OS version. Nevertheless, there are a few more things you should check.

In previous versions, this packaging was referred to as _Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition_.
====


== Launching the Installation Wizard

The installation wizard automatically configures most of the infrastructure that you need to run Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, automating the installation of Kubernetes and the instancing of multiple Docker containers that contain each of the components of the platform.


. Download the `anypoint-1.5.0-installer.tar.gz` installation package from the support portal

. Uncompress the gzip archive
+
----
tar -xvf anypoint-1.5.0-installer.tar.gz
----

. From the command line, move to the location where you unzipped this archive and run the following command:
+
----
./install
----

. The script will ask you what interface you want to listen on. Select the IP address you want to use out of the list that is presented and confirm this decision.

. In the output of this command, look for a network address that is signaled by the text `OPEN THIS IN BROWSER`
+
----
OPEN THIS IN BROWSER: https://{HOST}:61009/web/installer/new/gravitational.io/anypoint/{VERSION}?install_token={TOKEN}
----
+
Paste this address in a web browser to access the wizard.
+
[WARNING]
Firefox is not supported to run the installation wizard, please use a different browser.
+
[NOTE]
This is an *internal* IP, so you can use it to access the installer from within the network, but if you want to access it from outside the network you must replace it by its respective public IP.


== Running the Installation Wizard

[NOTE]
Follow the wizard steps in a single session without interruption. Otherwise this might cause an issue with the cookies stored in your browser.


Once in the installation wizard, follow the steps below to complete the installation:

. In the first screen, paste your Anypoint Platform license key. You should get this key from your sales representative. Then click *Continue*.

+

+
[NOTE]
After applying a new license, it may take the installer a moment to recognize it.

. Name your deployment, then choose a provider (pick the only available option in this case: *Bare Metal*). Then click *Continue*.
+
[TIP]
The name you give here won't affect the network address nor the organization name in Anypoint Platform.

+

. The next screen the installer asks you to select an installation _flavour_ and register each of your servers as nodes. You can click or drag the slider to select the number of servers, which automatically changes the flavour of the installation.

+

+
After installation, you can add or remove nodes as necessary using the link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/managing-via-the-ops-center[Ops Center].

. The next screen the installer asks you to pick an "installation flavour", each using a different ammount of servers to host the platform.
+
[NOTE]
Note that the one server installation is meant for demo purposes only.


. You must then register each of your servers as nodes. To register these servers, run a code in the command line of each. This code is presented to you on this screen with your specific credentials:

* A 1 node installation is intended for demo purposes. This option has lower hardware requirements, these are detailed in that step of the wizard.
+
[TIP]
The demo installation includes its own LDAP server to use together with it. See link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/demo-ldap-server[Demo LDAP Server] for details on what it contains and how to use it.

* A _3 node_ installation registers all servers as *General Purpose Nodes*
* A _6 node_ installation registers 3 nodes as *App-only* and the other 3 as *Data Store*

. To register your servers, you need to run a command on each's command console, with admin permissions. The command you must run is presented to you on this screen with your specific credentials:

+
image:installation-on-prem4.png[]
+
The command should have the following structure, but varies depending on the selected installation flavour you select and the type of the node:
+
----
curl -s --tlsv1.2 --insecure "https://mulesoft.gravitational.io:443/t/{TOKEN}/node" | sudo bash
----
+
Copy this command from the UI and run it on each of your nodes.


. After running this command on a node, the node becomes visible in the installer's UI. Each node has a set of fields to configure: an IP address and two devices to reference. For your devices, you can either leave the default references, or you can set up your own, see link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/prereq-workflow#device-requirements[Device Requirements] for details.

+

+
[NOTE]
Ensure that on each of your nodes, both devices are set up with enough space. See link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/prereq-workflow#device-requirements[Device Requirements]


. Once all of your nodes are visible and configured, click *Start Installation* to proceed to installing the software.
+
image:installing-anypoint-start-install.png[button]

. The installer then transitions through several different stages on its own. Wait for this process to finish.

+
image:Installer4-Progress.png[progess]

. The installer finally prompts you to provide the following data:

* Organization name
* Data for an admin user
** email
** username
** password

+
image:installing-anypoint-on-premises-user.png[]

+
[NOTE]
All of the users of your platform will log into accounts that belong to the organization name that you provide here, or a business group within it. See link:/access-management/organization[Organizations] for an overview on how these work.

. After installation is completed, the ops center password has to be reset. Please refer to link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/managing-via-the-ops-center#reset-password[reset password] for more details.


== Uninstall and reinstall

If you encounter any difficulties during the setup process, you may choose to attempt reinstallation. Before beginning a new install, you should ensure that all remenants of the original install have been removed. You can do that with the following commands on all nodes:

----
# remove installed system components
sudo gravity system uninstall --confirm

# remount and clear platform data
sudo mount /var/lib/gravity
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/gravity/*

# remount and clear platform data
sudo mount /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd/*

# remount and clear application data
sudo mount /var/lib/data
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/data/*
----

Depending on the state of the full or partial install that you are replacing, the above steps may not completely return the system to an installable state. Before beginning reinstall, you should ensure that your system is still setup correctly and meets the minimim disk and resource requirements just as you did intially.


[NOTE]
If you then wish to deploy your applications to link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/anypoint-platform-for-pcf[Pivotal Cloud Foundry], after completing the steps in this document you must then complete the steps that link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/configuring-anypoint-platform-for-pcf[Configuring Anypoint Platform for PCF] guides you through.
