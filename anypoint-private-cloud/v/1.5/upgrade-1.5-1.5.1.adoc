= To Migrate from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1

This topic describes how to migrate Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition from version 1.5.0 to 1.5.1.

[WARNING]
During the migration process, there may be some downtime as each node is migrated. Any users who are currently signed are be logged off.

== Prerequisites

Before migrating, perform the following prerequisites:

* Perform a backup of your system as described in link:backup-and-disaster-recovery[About Backup and Recovery].

* Ensure that your environment meets all of the system and network requirements described in link:system-requirements[About Minimum System Requirements]

* Enable TCP port 5973 intra-node to allow communication to the database cluster.

* Ensure you have permission to run the `sudo` command on the node where you launch the migration tool.

* Ensure the `kubectl` command is available in the node where you are performing the migration. To verify that kubectl is installed:
+
----
$ sudo gravity enter
$ kubectl
----

== To Perform the Upgrade

1. Use `ssh` to login to one of the nodes of your cluster.
+
Performing these procedures from a single node updates the entire platform.

1. Download the `anypoint-1.5.1-installer.tar.gz` package from the support portal.

1. Uncompress the gzip archive.
+
----
tar -xvf anypoint-1.5.1-installer.tar.gz
----

1. Navigate to the `anypoint-1.5.1` directory, then run the upload script.
+
----
sudo ./upload
----
+
This command updates the platform to the current version and restarts each pod in the cluster.
+
----
sudo ./upload
/etc/container-environment: line 19: --exec-opt: command not found

Depending on your network configuration, this command may take a while to complete. Wait until the command finishes before proceeding to the next step.

1. Ensure that all instances of the gravity component are running using the following command:
+
----
$ sudo gravity enter
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
----
+
This command displays output similar to the following:
