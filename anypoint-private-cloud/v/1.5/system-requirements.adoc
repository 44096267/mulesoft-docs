= About Minimum System Requirements

[WARNING]
This product was previously named Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition. Beginning with the 1.5.1 release, it is named Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

To ensure the performance and stability of Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, your environment must meet the minimum system requirements described in this topic. Before installing, review each of following sections and ensure that your environment meets these requirements.

[WARNING] 
If your system does not meet all of the minimum system requirements, you cannot install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

After ensuring that your environment meets all of the minimum requirements, see link:install-workflow[Workflow: Install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition] for information on installing the platform. During installation, the installer tests to ensure that you have enough enough disk space, disk speed, network speed, and a supported OS version.


[[supported-top]]
== Supported Network Topologies

To ensure platform peformance, stability, and high-availability, Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition supports two network topoligies that are outlined in the sections below.

In both configurations, to ensure high availability and performance, each node must run on its own server. If you are using a virtual machine to host these nodes, you must ensure that each VM node is running on a separate physical server.

[WARNING]
Only VMWare and bare metal virtualization environments are supported. For information on using VMWare, see link:prereq-create-vm-vmware[Creating a Virtual Machine using VMWare].

=== 3-node Configuration

The minimum supported network topology for a production environment is a 3-node configuration as shown in the following diagram:

image:prereqs-priv-cloud-3-node.png["3-node Configuration"]

Three nodes is the minimum number of nodes that can enable high-availability and failover. In this configuration, each node hosts the platform applications and services. You must configure a load balancer to use round-robin distribution of traffic among each of the three nodes.

Each node also hosts an instance of the database and file store. Hosting the database and object store enables persistence, but requires larger minimum disk and memory requirements. Although each node contains a database, only one of the database is used as the master. Applications on each node write to this database only. The other two database instances are used for data persistence.

=== 6-node Configuration

The maximum supported network topology is a 6-node configuration as shown in the following diagram:

image:prereqs-priv-cloud-6-node.png["6-node Configuration"]

In this configuration, three nodes are dedicated to hosting the platform applications and services. You must configure a load balancer to use round-robin distribution of traffic among each of these three nodes.

The other three nodes are used to host the database and file store instances. Only one of the database instances functions as the master database. Although each node contains a database, only one of the database nodes is used as the master. Applications on each node write to this database only. The other two nodes are used for data persistence.

[[hardware-req]]
== Hardware Requirements

For production usage, each node in your configuration must meet the following minimum requirements:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Component |Requirement
|RAM |32GB
|CPU |8 Cores
|HDD 1 (OS) |50GB
|HDD 2 (for System data) | 100GB
|HDD 3 (for Application data)| 250GB
|HDD 4 (for Docker) | 100GB
|HDD 5 (for etcd) | 20GB
|Networking (connectivity between hosts)  |1GbE
|===

=== Disk performance

All disks should be relatively performant, even if they are virtual block devices, or network attached storage. You can measure disk throughput with a tool such as `hdparm`. On CentOS `hdparm` can be installed by running `sudo yum install -y hdparm`.

=== Disk Throughput

All disks should have at least 300 MB/sec of throughput.


=== IOPS

Each of your disks should meet following performance quotas:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Disk |Recommended IOPS
|HDD 1 (OS) |500
|HDD 2 (for System data) | 1500
|HDD 3 (for Application data)| 1500
|HDD 4 (for Docker) | 3000
|HDD 5 (for etcd) | 3000

[[software-req]]
== Software Requirements

The following sections list the software required to install and run the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

=== Supported Linux Distributions

The following Linux distributions are supported:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), versions 7.2.x and 7.3.x
* CentOS, versions 7.2.x and 7.3.x

=== SELinux

If your system uses Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), it must be disabled or set to permissive mode.

[[network-req]]
== Network Requirements

The following sections describe the network requirements to run Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

=== Static IPs

All servers in the cluster should have static private IPv4 assigned to them, these must persist between server restarts. If IP addresses are not persistent between reboots, the cluster may enter a failed state.

=== VXLAN

This version of Kubernetes used by Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition uses an overlay VXLAN and uses UDP transport to encapsulate traffic.

There is direct communication between components of the cluster via TCP. The table below shows the ports used for inter-host communication:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Protocol |Port/Range |Purpose
|TCP | 6060 | Health check
|TCP |7469 |Cluster control plane
|UDP |8472 |Overlay VXLAN network
|TCP |6443 |Kubernetes API server
|TCP |8080 |Kubernetes API server
|TCP |10248-10255 |Kubernetes Kubelet
|TCP |2379, 2380, 4001, 7001 |etcd distributed database
|TCP | 5000 | Docker registry
|TCP |3008-3010, 3023-3025, 3080, 7575|cluster control plane
|TCP |30000-32767 |Internal services port range
|TCP | 7000, 7011, 7199, 9042, 9160 | Cassandra
|TCP | 18080, 18443 | Object store cluster
|TCP | 5431-5435,  | Database cluster
|TCP | 5973 | Database cluster
|TCP |61008-61010 | Installer port ranges (only used during install)
|TCP |61022-61024 | Installer port ranges (only used during install)

=== NAT Traffic

In some situation, the Kubernetes overlay network uses NAT. NAT requires that servers should be able to send and receive packages with a source and destination that is different from server’s internal IP.

=== SSL Certificate

In order to use the Anypoint Platform, you must provide SSL credentials. You can upload a certificate through the Anypoint Platform UI, see link:/access-management/private-cloud-edition-features#security[Private Cloud Edition features]. This certificate must be trusted by every machine that’s connected to the platform.

[WARNING]
You must register the same SSL certificate on every server with Mule Runtimes that are managed by this platform.

=== SMTP Server

Your network must include an SMTP server to manage e-mail alerts that are triggered by the platform. See link:/access-management/private-cloud-edition-features#smtp[on-prem features].

== Device Requirements

For the platform’s configuration you must assign two dedicated devices for use. One as a system state directory and the other as a target for Docker devicemapper configuration. These two directories must exist on every node of your cluster.

=== Anypoint system data device

The main purpose of the system state directory is storing system configuration and metadata - for example, database and packages among other things. As package sizes can be arbitrary large, it is important to estimate the minimum size requirements and allocate enough space as a dedicated device ahead of time.
