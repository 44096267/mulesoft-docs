= Configuring Anypoint Platform for PCF
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises

THIS TOPIC IS NO LONGER USED AND WILL BE DELETED

== Overview

For the Anypoint Platform for PCF solution to work, you must install and configure the following things:

* The <<Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF Tile>>
* The <<Mule Runtime BuildPack>>
* <<Set the PCF Flag Manually>>
* The <<Space Configuration Tool>>. This installs a bundle of elements that includes:
** The Cloud Manager, which mediates the communication between Anypoint Platform and PCF
** The *Runtime Manager Service* - Meant for Mule runtime applications
** The *API Gateway Service* - Meant for proxying non-Mule applications that are deployed on PCF


[NOTE]
====
To complete this process, you must contact you MuleSoft customer success representative.
== Set the PCF Flag Manually

In order to make PCF visible as an option on the Runtime Manager UI, you must manually enable a flag in the platform. Future releases will avoid needing this additional step.

[NOTE]
Contact your MuleSoft customer success representative to help you implement this change.




== Set up a Hazelcast Server

[NOTE]
This step is only necessary if you intend to deploy your Mule applications into clusters in PCF. For an explanation about the benefits of having your applications deployed as a cluster, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-high-availability-ha-clusters#the-benefits-of-clustering[Mule High Availability Clusters].

If you don’t have a Hazelcast cluster configured, you must configure one using the Mule Hazelcast server provided by MuleSoft. See link:/anypoint-private-cloud/v/1.5/pcf-mule-hazelcast[Mule Hazelcast server] for instructions on how to do this.

Once the cluster is installed, take note of the cluster node IPs and ports and the cluster group name and password. You will need this information to bind Mule runtime instances to the cluster.

=== Hazelcast as a PCF user-provided service

In order to allow your Mule applications to adopt the cluster configuration, you must create a user-provided service in PCF for each of the nodes in the Hazelcast cluster that you will be connecting your Mule applications to. You can do that through the following command:

[source]
----
cf cups HAZELCAST_NODE_NAME -p ‘{“host”:”HAZELCAST_NODE_IP”,"port":"HAZELCAST_NODE_PORT","clusterId":"HAZELCAST_CLUSTER_GROUP_NAME","clusterPassword":"HAZELCAST_CLUSTER_GROUP_PASSWORD"}'
----

In the above command, replace the following placeholders:

* `HAZELCAST_NODE_NAME`: Logical name of the Hazelcast node from the cluster that you are defining. It must start with hazelcast.
* `HAZELCAST_NODE_IP`: IP to connect to the Hazelcast node
* `HAZELCAST_NODE_PORT`: Port to connect to the Hazelcast node
* `HAZELCAST_CLUSTER_GROUP_NAME`: Group name set in the Hazelcast cluster configuration
* `HAZELCAST_CLUSTER_GROUP_PASSWORD`: Group password set in the Hazelcast cluster configuration

For example:

[source]
----
cf cups hazelcast_dev_node1 -p '{"host":"172.16.12.61","port":"5701","clusterId":"dev","clusterPassword":"dev-pass"}'
----
