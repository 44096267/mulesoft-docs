== To Create a Backup

To preserve your data in case of system failure, you must ensure that you system is automatically backed up. You should configure your backup to run at least once per day, although MuleSoft recommends that you back up your system hourly.

Your backup archive must be stored on external storage outside the Anypoint cluster.

You must perform backups from a master node of your installation. If you installed the platform with a six server configuration, only three of the servers are master nodes. If you are running 1 or 3 node installation, all nodes are master nodes.


1. Determine which node is registered as a master node:
+
----
kubectl get nodes -o yaml|grep master -A 5|grep hostname
----
+
You can run this command on any node in the cluster to determine which nodes are master nodes. 
+
To create a backup, you must run the following commands on a master node in the cluster.

1. Enter the gravity utility:
+
----
sudo gravity enter
----

1. Create a backup archive:
+
----
gravity system backup gravitational.io/anypoint:0.0.0+latest /ext/share/backup.tar.gz
----
+
This command creates an archive of the current system state in: `/var/lib/gravity/planet/share/backup.tar.gz`.

[WARNING]
====
After running the backup command, you may see the following error message:

`Error from server: container "anypoint-backup" in pod "anypoint-backup-<pod-id>" is waiting to start: PodInitializing`

This indicates that the Kubernetes pod running the backup job is not currently running.
====

== To Perform a System Restore

To restore a system from your backup, use the existing cluster or create a new cluster containing the same number of servers as the cluster being restored.

1. Log in to one of the nodes in your cluster.

1. Move the compressed archive file to: `/var/lib/gravity/planet/share`. You can transfer this file securely via the following command:
+
----
scp /backup-path/to-restore.tar.gz your_username@remotehost.edu:/var/lib/gravity/planet/share
----

1. Enter the gravity utility:
+
----
sudo gravity enter
----


1. Restore the cluster from the backup archive:
+
----
gravity system restore gravitational.io/anypoint:0.0.0+latest /ext/share/to-restore.tar.gz
----

1. Restart each of the pods in your cluster to use the updated secrets:
+
----
kubectl delete pods --all
----
+
Kubernetes creates an instance of every pod automatically. This will take a few minutes.
