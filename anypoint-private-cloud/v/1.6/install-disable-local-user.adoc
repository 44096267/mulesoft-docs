= To Disable the Local User after Installing Private Cloud Edition

During installation, Anypoint Private Cloud Edition creates a local Anypoint Platform user.
This user enables you to configure platform components during installation.
The credentials for this user are stored locally in Anypoint Platform. However, after configuring an external authentication provider such as LDAP, you may need to disable this user to ensure that all users are authenticated correctly.

== Prerequisites

Before disabling the local user, perform the following:

* Install and coonfigure your external identity provider.
* Ensure that SystemAdmin user is not the owner of any other organizations
