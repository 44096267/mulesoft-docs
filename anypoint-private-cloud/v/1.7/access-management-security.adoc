= To Configure Security for Anypoint Private Cloud

You can configure Anypoint Platform to use your own certificate. Additionally, you can choose the cipher and DH groups for the key exchange method, if required. The certificate you upload is used by Anypoint Platform. When you upload a new certificate, Anypoint Platform restarts the nginx server.

. Create a certificate.
+
You can use a tool like OpenSSL to create your certificate. To work with Anypoint Platform, your certificate must be in an `nginx` compatible format. The certificate must contain the domain name of your installation.

. From Anypoint Platform, select Access Management.
. In the left navigation bar, click Security.
. In the Certificate field, click Browse to select the certificate on your local system.
. In the Key field, click Browse button to select the private key for your certificate.
. Click the Save.
. Optionally, you can upload your own cipher and Diffie-Hellman group file.

This provides additional security for Anypoint Platform. However, this step is optional. In most environments you do not need to use this setting.

.. Deselect *Use default ciphers and DH Group*.
.. Enter a set of ciphers from the list of valid nginx ciphers. If you are using Open SSL, you can view this list by running the `openssl ciphers` command. The cipher you enter must be in an `nginx` compatible format as shown in the following example.
+
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384

.. Generate `dhparam.pem` (the Diffie-Hellman group file) using the following `openssl` command:
+
----
openssl dhparam 2048 -out dhparam.pem
----

.. Upload the `dhparam.pem` file from your system.
