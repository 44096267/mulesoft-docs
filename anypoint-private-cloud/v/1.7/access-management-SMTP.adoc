= To Configure SMTP in Anypoint Private Cloud

The Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition requires that you set up your own SMTP email server to deliver email alerts for both *API Manager* and *Runtime manager*. The SMTP section on the Access Management menu lets you reference the server that you set up.

[NOTE]
--
This service does not create an SMTP server for you. It is intended to configure with the settings of an existing SMTP server within your environment

In the left navigation bar, click the *SMTP* option and configure the details for your SMTP server:
