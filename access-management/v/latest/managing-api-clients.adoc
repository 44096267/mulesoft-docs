= About Client Management

As an API owner, you can apply an Anypoint Platform OAuth 2.0  policy to an API to authenticate client applications that try to access your API. In conjunction with the policy, you need to have a OAuth provider in place. One of the following OAuth providers is recommended:

* OpenAM
+
Anypoint Platform supports OpenAM versions 11 and 12. 
+
* PingFederate

// * OpenID Connect (add after GA , khahn 4.14.2017)

To use OpenAM or PingFederate for client management on Anypoint Platform (not Private Cloud Edition), you need to use one of these IdPs. To configure an external OAuth 2.0 server through OpenAM or PingFederate follow one of the procedures in this documentation. Within 48 hours, you receive confirmation of or follow-up questions to complete the configuration.

=== Using Authorization and Authentication

To protect a non-trivial resource, two layers, authorization and authentication, are typically used for identity and client management, respectively. OpenAM and PingFederate can manage users and client management simultaneously.

Client management might not be available to you, depending on the license you purchased.


=== Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition

If you are using Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you do not need to configure OpenAM or PingFederate by completing the OpenAM or PingFederate form.
