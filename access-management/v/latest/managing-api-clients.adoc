= Managing API Clients

Client Management allows any client connecting to your application to identify itself using OAuth 2.0.

[NOTE]
--
Client management is only available for Enterprise Edition users
--

[CAUTION]
Having a single audience (an Anypoint Platform organization) served by multiple issuers (multiple SAML provider instances) is currently not supported.

== openAM

If you want to use openAM for client management and if you're *not using* Anypoint Platform on premises, you need to request that your account be configured in that way, as you can't set this up manually. +
Work with your MuleSoft account representative to ensure that we are aware of your needs for configuring your organization with openAM.

Complete the link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZvNUWU3u0lzLk6H5R3lKcEN2Dcyg1zekc1HYtYIcZP0/viewform[OpenAM form] and MuleSoft will get back to you within 48 hours with either the completion of the configuration or follow-up questions to complete the configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using Anypoint Platform on premises, you do not need to provide this information to MuleSoft.

== Ping Federate

If you want to use Ping Federate for client management and if you're *not using* Anypoint Platform on premises, you need to request that your account be configured in that way, as you can't set this up manually. +
Work with your MuleSoft account representative to ensure that we are aware of your needs for configuring your organization with PingFederate.

== External Oauth 2.0 Provider

By deploying your application and exposing its API through an link:/api-manager/tutorial-create-an-api-portal[API Portal] you can apply an link:/api-manager/external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy[Oauth token validation policy] to manage your clients.

You can generate link:/api-manager/browsing-and-accessing-apis#accessing-your-application-client-id-and-client-secret[API credentials] and grant them to your clients through an *external Oauth service provider*  +
Learn how to create your own Oauth provider following link:/api-manager/building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application[this tutorial].


= Single Log Out

Single log out is important so that a user or user agent can log out of an authenticated environment and ensure that both service providers and identity servers process the log out correctly.

To configure single log out:

. In PingFederate, click the *SP Configuration* for the Anypoint Platform.
. Go to *Browser SSO* and click *Configure Browser SSO*.
. Under *SAML Profiles*, ensure that these are set:
** *IdP-Initiated SSO*
** *IdP-Initiated SLO*
** *SP-Initiated SLO*
. Go to *Protocol Settings* and click *Configure Protocol Settings*.
. Configure a *SLO Service Url* with the following:
** *Binding*: POST
** *Endpoint URL*: Set PARTNER_SP_ID to the correct value: `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/logout/receive-id`
+
It's also possible to control where the user is redirected after signing out. Most customers like to redirect the user to a different page so we allow you to configure that in your PingFederate's service provider configuration. You can add a `redirect_uri` query parameter to the SLO Service URL and the Anypoint Platform routes the user there rather than to the Anypoint Platform sign-in page.
+
For example, if you want to route the users back to your signin page, make the URL:
+
[source]
----
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/logout/receive-id?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fanypoint.mulesoft.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2Fyour-domain
----
+
If you want to route the users back to your portal page, make the URL:
+
[source]
----
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/logout/receive-id?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fanypoint.mulesoft.com%2Fapiplatform%2Fyour-domain%2F%23%2Fportals
----
+
. Under *Allowable SAML Bindings*, click *Redirect*.
. Under *Encryption Policy*, make certain that nothing is encrypted.
. Save and click *Done* out of *Protocol Settings* and *Browser SSO*.
. When viewing the *SP Configuration* for Anypoint Platform, go to *Credentials*, and click *Configure Credentials*.
. Under *Signature Verification Settings*, click *Manage Signature Verification Settings*. Set the *Trust Model* to *Unanchored*, and import the link:_attachments/anypoint-platform-slo.pem[attached certificate]. Make it the active certificate.
