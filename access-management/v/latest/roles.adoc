= Roles

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have an Organization Administrator role in your organization, or that you have API Version Owner permissions and want to manage user permissions for your API version.

== Overview

A _role_ within the Anypoint Platform is a set of pre-defined permissions for each different product within the Platform. +
Depending on the product, you can find pre-defined roles with their standard permissions, or you can customize your own permissions for each role. +

The *Access Management* section grants you a space in which you can create Roles for the products to which you own the appropriate entitlements.

== Default Roles

These are the default roles available in every new organization and business group when first created:

[width="100%",cols="30%,80%",options="header",]
|===
a| Role Name a| Description
|API Creators |Create and manage API versions in the Anypoint Platform for APIs. +
Members of the API Creator role have the ability to add new APIs to the platform on the API administration page. +
This role grants no permissions on CloudHub.
|Portals Viewer | Portal Viewers can see a list of the Private API Portals to which they have Portal Viewer permissions from the Developer Portal. They can also click to view those API Portals. +
Note that the ability to view an API Portal does not automatically give a user access to the API. Also note that you cannot grant Portal Viewer permissions unless the API has an API Portal.
|API Version Owner | API Version Owners can view specific versions of the API that they own. +
They inherit *Portal Viewer* permissions by default for any API Portals that you create for the API versions they own.
|Audit Log Viewers | Users of this role have access to the UI for the Audit Log under Access Management.
|Cloudhub Admin |Access to all CloudHub functionality.
|Cloudhub Developer |Access to all CloudHub functionality, except organization and billing settings.
|Cloudhub Support |Read-only access to dashboards, notifications, alerts, logs, and their user settings.
|Organization Administrators |Editing access to all versions of all APIs, all registered applications, and all API Portals in the Anypoint Platform. Access to the Organization Administration page, where they can add and manage users and roles, view and edit organization details, access the client ID and client secret for the organization, and customize the theme of the Developer Portal. +
Members of the Organization Administrator role also inherit the role of *API Creator* by default.
|Exchange Administrators | Approves Exchange artifacts that the contributor creates so that the artifact can be published in Exchange
|Exchange Contributors | Contributes Exchange artifacts.
|Exchange Viewers | Views Exchange artifacts
|===

If you click on a role, you can edit it, change its name or description and add or remove users to it.

[NOTE]
--
The user who first signs up for the Anypoint Platform organization is known as the *Organization Owner*. This is not a role but an identifier for this single user, who inherits the Organization Administrator role by default.

When the Organization Owner creates a business-group, it must assign a user as the owner of it. This user holds an Administrator role within that business group by default.

== Managing Roles

To access the *Roles* menu, first make sure you're in the correct business group (by clicking the menu next to your username on the top-right of the screen), then click the gear icon next to it, and then pick the appropriate link in the left menu.

As an Admin of your organization, you can create or delete roles, define what permissions each grants, and what users own it. +
As the owner of a business group, you can create and define roles and permissions within that business group, granting access only to resources that exist within that business group.

Click the Add Role button to add a new role. Once created, you can look for it on the table and click on it to add permissions, API resources, and users to it. By ticking the checkbox next to a role, the delete button becomes visible.

=== Creating Custom Roles

As an organization administrator, you can create custom roles by combining API resources, permissions, and users.

. Click the *Roles* tab in the left navigation of your Organization Administration page.
. Click *Add role*.
. Enter a *Name* and *Description* for your custom role.
. Your custom role now appears in your list of roles. Click the name of your new role to continue.
. On the API Permissions tab, click *Add an API resource* and search for the APIs that you want to include in this role. 
. Select the *Version* and *Permission* that you want to give to this role.
. Commit your choice by clicking the green checkmark.
. Click the *Users* tab. 
. Search for the users that you want to add, one by one, using their name, username, or email address.
. Commit each user using the green check mark.

To edit your custom role at any time, return to your Roles tab, click the name of the role, and add or delete APIs, permissions, or users as needed.

You can delete custom roles within the Organizer Administrator or API Creator roles, but you cannot delete these roles themselves. To delete a custom role, check the box next to the role name, then click *Delete*.

== Role Mapping

You can set up your Anypoint Platform organization so that when a SAML user belongs to certain groups, Anypoint Platform automatically grants certain equivalent roles in your Anypoint Platform organization.

For a full description on how to do this, follow the instructions in our link:/access-management/external-identity#federated-organizations-map-users-to-anypoint-platform-roles[external identity] section.
