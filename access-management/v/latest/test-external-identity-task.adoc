= To Test External Identity

After configuring your organization’s external identity provider, you can test the integration.

. Go to your organization’s login URL, for example:
+
`+https:/anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/{organization-domain-name}+` 
+
. Find your organization’s domain name by logging into your Anypoint Platform administrator account.
. Click Access Management > Organization.
. Select your organization name. Select Domain Name.
+
If the Domain Name is that of your IdP, the integration is a success. The next time you log in, you are redirected to your identity provider. After authenticating, you are redirected back to Anypoint Platform as an authenticated user.
