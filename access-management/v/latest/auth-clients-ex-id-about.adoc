= About Client Management

As an API owner, you can apply an Anypoint Platform OAuth 2.0  policy to an API to authenticate client applications that try to access your API. In conjunction with the policy, you need to have a OAuth provider in place. One of the following OAuth providers is recommended:

* OpenAM
* PingFederate

// * OpenID Connect (add after GA , khahn 4.14.2017)

=== Using Authorization and Authentication

To protect a non-trivial resource, two layers, authorization and authentication, are typically used for identity and client management, respectively. OpenAM and PingFederate can manage users and client management simultaneously.

Client management might not be available to you, depending on the entitlements you purchased.

== OpenAM

Anypoint Platform supports OpenAM versions 11 and 12. 

=== Anypoint Platform

To use OpenAM or PingFederate for client management on Anypoint Platform (not Private Cloud Edition), configure your account for using one of these IdPs. Follow the procedure to configure client management in this documentation. Within 48 hours, you receive confirmation of or follow-up questions to complete the configuration.

=== Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition

If you are using Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you do not need to complete the OpenAM or PingFederate form.
