:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring, pingfederate, saml

As the Anypoint Platform administrator, you set up users for single sign-on (SSO) by configuring identity management in Anypoint Platform using one of the following authorization systems:

* SAML 2.0
+
Web-based authorization including cross-domain SSO
+
* OpenId Connect
+
End-User identity verification by an authorization server including SSO

Service initiated-SSO is not supported. 

== Using SAML 2.0 

Before using SAML 2.0, you need to select an identity management provider (IdP). Although any SAML 2.0 compliant provider can be configured for this use, the following IdPs have been successfully tested with Anypoint Platform:

Only the master Organization can configure external identity. The configuration applies to all child Business Groups. The IdP you choose is effective for the entire organization and all business groups.
