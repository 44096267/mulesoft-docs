== Selecting an Identity Management Provider

Before configuring OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0, you need to select an identity management provider (IdP). If you intend to use OpenID Connect, choose an OpenID Connect-compliant provider, such as Salesforce; otherwise, choose any SAML 2.0 compliant provider. The following SAML IdPs have been successfully tested with Anypoint Platform:

* Ping Federate
* OpenAM
* Okta
* Shibboleth
* ADFS
* onelogin
* CA SiteMinder

Before configuring OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0, set up your Anypoint Platform organization as your audience in your IdP configuration. 


== Configuring OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0

You configure identity management in the Anypoint Platform master organization. The IdP you are set up to use, and your configuration of the authorization system, is effective for the entire organization and all business groups. Familiarize yourself with your IdP documentation. All attribute names you configure must match on both the IdP and Anypoint Platform side. 

Follow the procedures to configure OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 in this documentation.

== LDAP in Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition

As the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition administrator, you set up LDAP for single sign-on. Follow the procedure to configure LDAP in Anypoint Private Cloud in this documentation. 

Identity management might not be available to you, depending on the license you purchased. Contact your account representative to obtain the required license.
