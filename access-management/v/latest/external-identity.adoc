= About Identity Management
:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring, pingfederate, saml

As the Anypoint Platform administrator, you set up users for single sign-on (SSO) by configuring an external identity user management process. Users can then log in using a single ID and password to Anypoint Platform and other software systems you include in the SSO group. Using out-of-the-box asset management capabilities in Anypoint Platform, you can set up users, roles, and permissions to resources, but SSO is not included. To provide SSO to users, you need to adopt one of the following federated identity providers (IdPs):

* SAML 2.0
+
Web-based authorization including cross-domain SSO
+
* OpenId Connect
+
End-User identity verification by an authorization server including SSO
+
* LDAP (Private Cloud Edition only)
+
A protocol for locating users and other resources on the internet or an intranet

Only SSO initiated by one of these providers is supported. Service initiated-SSO is not supported. The IdP you choose is effective for the entire organization and all business groups. To use OpenAM or PingFederate for identity management on Anypoint Platform, configure your account for using one of these IdPs.

// Should the bit about Private Cloud that we have in the client management doc appear here?

The following diagram shows the SSO process:
