= About Identity Management
:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring, pingfederate, saml

As the Anypoint Platform administrator, you set up users for single sign-on (SSO) by configuring identity management in Anypoint Platform using one of the following single sign-on standards:

* OpenID Connect
+
End-User identity verification by an authorization server including SSO
+
* SAML 2.0
+
Web-based authorization including cross-domain SSO

Service initiated-SSO is not supported. 

The following diagram shows the identity management process using SAML as an example:

== Before Configuring Identity Management

Before configuring OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0, you need to select an identity management provider (IdP). If you intend to use OpenID Connect, choose an OpenID Connect-compliant provider, such as Salesforce; otherwise, choose any SAML 2.0 compliant provider. The following SAML IdPs have been successfully tested with Anypoint Platform:

* Ping Federate
* OpenAM
* Okta
* Shibboleth
* ADFS
* onelogin
* CA SiteMinder

// Before configuring OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0, set up your Anypoint Platform organization as your audience in your IdP configuration. (doesn't make sense bec the form you configure signs you up for the IdP service.)


== Configuring OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0

You configure identity management in the Anypoint Platform master organization. The IdP you choose, and your configuration of the authorization system, is effective for the entire organization and all business groups. After choosing an identity provider (IdP), familiarize yourself with the IdP documentation. 

// All attribute names you configure must match on both the IdP and Anypoint Platform side. (doesn't make sense bec the form you configure signs you up for the IdP service.)

Follow the procedures to configure OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 in this documentation. 

If any information needs to be changed after submitting the configuration form, log into the MuleSoft Support Portal and submit a request.

// Should the bit about Private Cloud that we have in the client management doc appear here?

== LDAP in Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition

As the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition administrator, you set up LDAP for single sign-on. 

Identity management might not be available to you, depending on the license you purchased. Contact your account representative to obtain the required license.
