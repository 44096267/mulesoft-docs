= To Troubleshoot SAML Assertions

Anypoint Platform does not generate the SAML assertion for the single sign on. The Sign On URL that you configure is the initiated SSO of your IdP. Some IdPs support generating sample assertions. If your IdP generates sample assertions, follow this procedure to get MuleSoft to assist you in troubleshooting your SAML assertions. 

. After successfully authenticating to the IdP, capture a SAML assertion by inspecting the `HTTP POST` sent by the browser to the following SAML Assertion URL:
+
`+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id+`
+
. Use Chrome Developer Tools, Firebug for Firefox, or a SAML tracer to inspect the HTTP request, which is base64-encoded.
. Log in to the MuleSoft Support Portal at the following URL:
+
`+https://www.mulesoft.com/support-login+`
+
. Provide a screen shot of your SAML configuration in Anypoint Platform.
. Include an XML SAML assertion.
