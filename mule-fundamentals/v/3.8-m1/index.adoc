*Mule* is the *lightweight integration runtime engine* that allows you to connect anything, anywhere. Rather than creating multiple point-to-point integrations between systems, services, APIs, and devices, you can use Mule to intelligently manage message routing, data mapping, orchestration, reliability, security, and scalability between nodes. Plug other systems and applications into Mule and let it handle all the communication between systems, enabling you to track and monitor everything that happens.

Mule is so named because it “carries the heavy load” of developing an infrastructure to support multiple applications and systems.

== The Mule Way

Flexible and reliable by design, Mule is an enterprise service bus (ESB) for integration that can adjust to the demands of an interconnected network of systems and applications. As you quickly learn by designing Mule applications in Anypoint Studio, there is a plethora of components that can be used to transform and capture information as "Mule messages" as it moves from one Mule component to the next. Every event that Mule is aware of can be coordinated in a Mule application, according to business needs.

== With Mule you can...

* *integrate* applications or systems on premises or in the cloud
* use out-of-the-box connectors to create *SaaS integration* applications
* build and *expose APIs*
* *consume APIs*
* create Web services which *orchestrate calls* to other services
* create interfaces to expose applications for *mobile consumption*
* *integrate B2B* with solutions that are secure, efficient, and quick to build and deploy
* shift applications onto the *cloud*
* connect *B2B e-commerce* activities
