IntelliJ includes out of the box Maven support therefore it doesn't require for you to download any extra plugins.

[WARNING]
This guide was built using IntelliJ X but earlier or later versions should work as well

. After you have generated your project with our Maven archetype, choose *File -> New Project* and select *Import project from an external resource*
