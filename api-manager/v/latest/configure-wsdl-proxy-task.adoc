= To Configure a WSDL Proxy (New)

In Mule 4 Early Access, auto-deployment isn't supported. You need to download a WSDL proxy from API Manager and configure it. In this procedure, you modify the proxy config.properties file to match WSDL of the service. In this example, the properties in config.properties are service.name, service.name, service.port and the WSDL location is `+http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl+`.

. If you have not already created a WSDL asset in Exchange, create a new WSDL asset. See link below.
. In API Manager > Manage API > Manage API from Exchange, configure management of the asset. See link below. Specify that you're using Mule 4 by checking this box: Check This Box If You Are Managing This Api In Mule 4.
. Save the configuration and download the proxy. See link below.
. After downloading the proxy in API Manager, run the following command:
+
`unzip proxy.jar -d proxyFolder`
+
The proxy.jar and proxyFolder represent the name and location of the downloaded JAR.
+
In the config.properties file in proxyFolder, include the information from API Manager > API Administration > instance name.
+
* api.id
+
The ID, generated by API Manager, of new APIs managed by API Manager. The API ID is displayed on the API instance dashboard.
+
* proxy.path
+
Default value: /
+
* proxy.port
+
Default value: 8081
+
* proxy.responseTimeout
+
The time that the proxy can wait until it times out. Default value: 10000 ms
+
* wsdl
+
The location of your wsdl spec, for example an url. Don’t forget to append the query string “?wsdl” at the end of it. 
* service.namespace
+
The target namespace of your web service.
Below you will find an example of how to complete this field.
+
* service.name
+
The name of the service the proxy represents. This proxy supports only one service.
Below you will find an example of how to complete this field.
+
* service.port
+
The name of the port for the service the proxy represents. This proxy supports only one port. 
. Regenerate the JAR using the following command:
+
`zip -r configuredProxy.jar proxyFolder`
+
Include all files _within_ the folder, but do _not_ include the root proxyFolder; otherwise, Mule Runtime rejects the app.
