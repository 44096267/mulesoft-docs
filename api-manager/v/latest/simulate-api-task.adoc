= To Simulate API calls

To simulate the API, you call the API in the API console and check the responses. The RAML you downloaded specifies the following `responses` for the methods:

* `200` (OK) response for all methods
* `500` (server error) response for the `POST order` method in case something fails on the server side
* `400` (client error) response for the `GET status` resource in case the user requests a nonexistent order

In the case of this API, the service behind the API generates the actual response that a user receives. The response example in the RAML is for  previewing the response in API Console.

To simulate calls to the API and preview the responses:

. Above the API console on the right, turn on the Mocking Service.

+
The `baseUri` has been commented out and replaced by a new URI.
+
. In the API console, click the GET tab for `/products`, and then click *Try It*.
+
. Repeat the last step for the other tabs, and enter these parameters on the `status` tab:
+
* Order ID: `4321`
* Email: `max@mail.com`
+
The call returns a status 200 and example responses provided in the RAML file.

== Simulating Calls to the API in API Console

You can simulate calling the API in the API console. 

. Above the API console on the right, turn on the *Mocking Service*.
+
In your RAML definition, the `baseUri` changes to a mocking service URI.
+
. In the API Console, click the *GET* tab.

+
Click *Try it*, then *GET* to return the example data.
+
The user information in your example appears:

. Click the GET tab for the `/userbyid` resource. Click *Try it*, accept the default query parameter ID = 3, and click GET.

The user information appears for the user having an ID 3.

== Calling the Actual API 

Instead of simulating the API, you can get the actual data from the JSONPlaceHolder service instead of the example data in your RAML.

. Turn the mocking service off in API Console.
. Save all files in the project.
. link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy#setting-up-a-proxy[Configure a proxy and deploy the API] to Cloudhub.
. Issue the following call to get the actual user list:
+
`+http://placeholder.cloudhub.io/users+`

The actual user list from the JSONplaceholder site appears.
