= To Configure Auto-Discovery in Mule 4

In a Mule 4 app, to identify an API you need to provide its apiId and a reference to the APIs main flow. The main flow is where the HTTP listener is defined. The apiId in Mule 4 replaces the API Name and API Version used to specify auto-discovery in releases before Mule 4. Mule 4 supports tracking an API that resides in Exchange instead of creating an API in API Manager, which resulted in this change. 

Use the following syntax for specifying the apiId:

`<api-gateway:autodiscovery apiId="${api.id}" flowRef="proxy" />`
