= To Manage an API from Exchange (Latest)

You need to have access to an API in your organization's Exchange to perform this procedure. For example, in Design Center create an API and publish it to Exchange. After setting up the API to manage it from Exchange, the API version, status, and other information appears in API Manager. With this set up, you can configure and manage the API.

. Click API Manager in tne Anypoint Platform navigation bar.
+
API Administration opens in your default environment, such as Sandbox.
+
. In API Administration, select Manage API > Manage API From Exchange.

+
. In Manage API from Exchange, select options:
+
* In API Name, search for and select the API you want to manage from the list of available APIs in Exchange.
* In API Version, select a version of the API.
* In Asset Version, select the Exchange asset version, which corresponds to the RAML version of the API.
+
A link to the RAML specification for viewing appears.
+
* In Managing Type, choose Basic Endpoint or Endpoint with Proxy.
+
Set up a basic endpoint if you create your API outside API Manager, but you want to apply policies or otherwise manage the API using API Manager. For example, if you create the API using Mule Runtime, you don't need a proxy.
+
* In Implementation URI, enter the URL of the site that hosts the API.
* If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, select a proxy deployment target Cloudhub or Hybrid.
+
A hybrid is a product for managing servers.
+
If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, also accept the default Path `/` for the proxy endpoint, or enter another path. For example, changing the path to `/users` makes the REST call to the service at the implementation URI `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`. 
. Click Save, or optionally set advanced options, and then save.
. In Advanced Options, optionally assign a label for the proxy, or accept the default label, and set a response timeout.
+
The API appears in the API administration dashboard.
