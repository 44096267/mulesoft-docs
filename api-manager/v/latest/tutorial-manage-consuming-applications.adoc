= Manage API Access Requests
:keywords: portal, api, console, documentation

After you link:/api-manager/tutorial-manage-an-api#adding-an-sla-tier[define an SLA] for an API, you can approve or revoke access requests from app developers. This action binds consumption of the application to an SLA. If a developer link:/api-manager/browsing-and-accessing-apis#accessing-api-portals[requests access] to your API at a higher SLA tier than you want to approve, you can override the request by applying another SLA tier.

To manage API access requests to SLA-managed APIs:

Assume you defined SLAs for the API and an app requests access to the Premium SLA tier of the API from its portal.

. On the API version details page, on the *Applications* tab, click the name of the SLA tier below *Requested SLA tier*. For example, click Premium.
+
A drop-down of available SLAs appear.
+
. Select the SLA tier you want to apply to the app.
. Click *Approve* or *Reject* to grant or deny access.

A *Revoke* button for revoking access replaces *Approve*, *Reject*, and *Delete* buttons.
