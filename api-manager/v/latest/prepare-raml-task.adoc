= To Prepare RAML for Client-ID Based Policies (New and Classic)

If your API exposes a RAML definition that users might need to reference, then the RAML definition should reliably detail every element that is expected in calls to your API. Applying a client ID-based policies implies that all requests coming to your API include a client ID and client Secret (by default expected as query parameters). To prevent user requests from being rejected, create a trait in the RAML root and then reference this trait in every operation of your API. The trait might look like this:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
traits:
  - rate-limited:
      queryParameters:
       client_id:
        type: string
      client_secret:
        type: string
----

And then you can apply this trait in each individual operation like this:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
/products:
  get:
    is: [rate-limited]
    description: Gets a list of all the inventory products.
