= About Configuring an Endpoint

This configuration sets up an API proxy to control access to a web service. In Status on the API version details page of an API, click Configure Endpoint, and select the following options:

* Accept the default Endpoint with a Proxy or select Basic Endpoint if you create your API outside API Manager. For example, if you create the API using Mule ESB, you don't need a proxy, so select Basic Endpoint.
* Accept the default endpoint Type, RAML for example, or select one of the other Type options.
* In Implementation URI, accept the default, which is based on the baseUri in the RAML definition, or enter one of the other URI options.
* In Proxy Settings, select one of the following options:
+
** Select Configure Proxy for CloudHub to deploy to CloudHub. This option fixes the port number to a specific value required by CloudHub.
+
** Select Reference User Domain. This option requires creation of an API Gateway domain.
+
** Accept the default (neither option is checked).
+
* In Scheme, accept the default HTTP, or select HTTPS.
+
* Specify a Port value and a Path, or accept the defaults.
+
* Optionally, customize the response timeout of the auto-generated proxy you are creating for deployment.

Choose this option if you built the API using APIkit, and then, enter the address of the HTTP Listener of your deployed APIkit application in Implementation URI. The application can be running on-premises or on CloudHub. For example: `+http://localhost:8086/api+` or `+http://ab-tshirt-orders.cloudhub.io+`
+
* RAML
+
Choose this option if you built the API using RAML.
+
* WSDL

Choose this option to manage an existing SOAP API. For the Implemention URI option, enter this address: `+http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl+`
