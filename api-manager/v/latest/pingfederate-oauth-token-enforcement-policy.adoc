= PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement Policy
:keywords: pingfederate, oauth, api, credentials

The PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy connects to your existing PingFederate authorization server and enforces access according to your configuration. Anypoint platform supports the link:https://www.pingidentity.com/en/products/pingfederate.html[Ping Federate] identity provider (IdP) link:/access-management/external-identity#instructions-for-saml-configuration[configured for SAML 2.0]-compliant identiy management.

== Prerequisites

This policy is available only if the following prerequisites are met:

* Your organization is PingFederate
* Your user is the organization's administrator, or has permissions to create or manage APIs

If the OAuth token is not valid, PingFederate returns aÂ `403 FORBIDDEN` error.

== Policy Implementation

This diagram shows how the PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy works with an existing PingFederate authorization server to protect access to an API.

The user authorizes the application to access the API by authenticating with user credentials. Upon receiving a valid user authorization, PingFederate supplies the application with a valid token. The application sends the valid token in the API call. The PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy checks that the token in the header or query parameter is valid and matches the correct scopes. The policy invokes your organization's PingFederate authorization server to validate the token and check scopes, and finally the API receives the call from the application.

== Configuration

There is minimal configuration necessary for the PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement policy. The connection to your PingFederate authorization server is handled behind the scenes, so the only field you need to configure to apply the policy to your API version is `scopes`. Enter a space-separated list of strings that indicate the scopes to which applications must have access per their credentials defined for that application in PingFederate.

You need to know the names of the scopes as defined in PingFederate. Scope names are case-sensitive.

== Incorporating Authorization into an API
