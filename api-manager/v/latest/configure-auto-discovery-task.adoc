= To Configure Auto-Discovery (Latest and Classic)

In a Mule 4 app, to identify an API you need to provide its apiId and a reference to the API's main flow. The main flow is where the HTTP listener is defined. The apiId in Mule 4 replaces the API Name and API Version used to specify auto-discovery in releases before Mule 4. 

This procedure describes how to find the environment credentials and configure auto-discovery.

== Mule 4

This procedure assumes you created instances of an API version.

. On the API administration dashboard, expand the API version name to display the instances.

. Click an instance name.

The environment credentials, ID:Label (31429:Basic516) in this example appear:
+

. Use the following syntax for specifying the apiId:

`<api-gateway:autodiscovery apiId="${api.id}" flowRef="proxy" />`

== Mule 3.8.x

Configure a production API Gateway for integration with Anypoint Platform. For more information, see the link below for configuring API Gateway.
