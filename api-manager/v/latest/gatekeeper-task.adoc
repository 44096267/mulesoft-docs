= To Enable Gatekeeper

The released version of Gatekeeper is enabled by default in the standalone version of Mule. The development version of Gatekeeper in Studio 6.0.1 is disabled by default. Enable and configure the gatekeeper property to enhance security. Add and set the `anypoint.platform.gatekeeper` property to true in the Mule `wrapper.conf` file. For example:

----
 #On-Prem Configuration: 
 ...
 wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.gatekeeper=true
 ...
----
