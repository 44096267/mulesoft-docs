API Gateway, incorporated in Mule Runtime 3.8 and later, is the server that hosts a Mule proxy application. To deploy an API from API Manager, you typically create a proxy application that serves to stop attacks aimed at the actual server. This proxy application is sometimes called an auto-generated proxy.

// You can use API Designer, AnyPoint Studio, or Mule runtime to design, run, and debug code prior to deployment of the proxy in API Manager. 

After deploying an API, you can govern the API using policies. You can set API alerts to send a notification about conditions, such as an API returning a certain HTTP error code.

== Deployment Prerequisites

You need to meet the following prerequisites, depending on the type of deployment:

*General Prerequisites*

* Presence of an API version in API Manager
* API Versions Owner permissions for the API, or membership in the Organization Administrators role 
* The URL of the server where the API is running

*Deployment to your server*

Access to a Mule 3.8.0 Runtime instance or an API Gateway instance that has been configured to pair with your organization. Configure the API Gateway if using versions of Mule earlier than 3.8.0.

*Automatic deployment to your server*

Valid permissions for the Runtime Manager and the API Manager of your organization. Also, the private server must be registered.

*Automatic CloudHub deployment*

Permissions for the Runtime Manager and API Manager of your organization.

*Manual CloudHub deployment*

An Anypoint Platform account and an Anypoint Platform client ID and client secret to pair the deployment with an organization.

You need valid permissions for the Runtime Manager and API Manager of your organization to deploy a proxy.

== Using HTTPS

When deploying to the CloudHub, you can perform an automatic deployment only if you use an HTTP listener that doesn't enable HTTPS. If you use HTTPS, add your HTTPS credentials and then perform a link:/api-manager/deploy-to-api-gateway-runtime#manual-deployment-to-cloudhub[manual deployment] to CloudHub or deploy on premises.

HTTPS can be applied in the following ways:

* Between the proxy and the client app (1)
* Between the proxy and the API (2)

The way you apply HTTPS and deploy the proxy determines the method you use for setting up the proxy. The following sections describe these methods.

=== HTTPS with the Client App - On Premises

. In the Configure Endpoint menu, select HTTPS as a *scheme* on the dropdown menu.
. The generated proxy has an inbound HTTP Listener connector that references an alternative HTTP Listener Configuration element in a domain, if you use a domain, that uses HTTPS. This configuration element exists in the default Domain file in the API Gateway, but it's commented out.
.. In the API Gateway folder, open the file `domains/api-gateway/mule-domain-config.xml`. It should look like this:
+

   <http:listener-config name="http-lc-0.0.0.0-8081" host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" protocol="HTTP"/>
 
<!--
    <http:listener-config name="https-lc-0.0.0.0-8082" host="0.0.0.0" port="8082" protocol="HTTPS">
        <tls:context name="tls-context-config">
            <tls:key-store path="[replace_with_path_to_keystore_file]" password="[replace_with_store_password]" keyPassword="[replace_with_key_password]"/>
        </tls:context>
    </http:listener-config>
-->
</mule-domain>
----
+
.. Uncomment the HTTP `http:listener-config` element named `https-lc-0.0.0.0-8082`
.. Fill in the keystore fields in that element with your specific keystore data.
Your proxy is ready to deploy.

=== HTTPS with the Client App - On CloudHub

. In the Configure Endpoint dialog, select HTTPS as a *scheme* on the dropdown menu.
. Download the proxy and <<Modify a Proxy Application, modify it>> to include an HTTPS Configuration element with HTTPS credentials. 
. Include the following lines of code into your proxy's `proxy.xml` file, include this outside any of the flows:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="https-lc-0.0.0.0-8082" host="0.0.0.0" port="8082" protocol="HTTPS">
    <tls:context name="tls-context-config">
       <tls:key-store path="[replace_with_path_to_keystore_file]" password="[replace_with_store_password]"
             keyPassword="[replace_with_key_password]"/>
    </tls:context>
</http:listener-config>
----
+
Replace the placeholders with the actual path and passwords of the keystore. 
. Verify that the  `http:listener` element in the flow is correctly referencing this new configuration element you just added.
+
[source,code]
----
config-ref="https-lc-0.0.0.0-8082"
----

=== HTTPS with the API

. In the Configure Endpoint menu, provide an implementation URI to an HTTPS address. Specifying an HTTPS address modifies the proxy to support HTTPS. By default, the proxy signs requests using the default HTTPS credentials of the JVM.
. If you want to include other HTTPS credentials, download the proxy and modify it accordingly.
+
If you plan to import your proxy application into Studio 6.x or later, you can choose in API Manager whether to link:/api-manager/api-gateway-domain[link the application to a domain] or not. When importing your proxy application into Studio 5.x, your project is linked to a *domain* project named `api-gateway`, which is automatically created in studio if not already present. This domain project is identical to the domain that exists in CloudHub and in your default API Gateway On-Premises. It's necessary for being able to deploy your app to the Anypoint Studio server under the same conditions as those present when you deploy the app to production. If you modify your domain on the On-Premises installation to include HTTPS credentials, replicate those changes on the domain that exists in Studio to match deployment conditions.

== To Modify a Proxy

In most cases, the proxy you generate in API Manager is suitable for deployment out of the box. However, you can modify the proxy to log data to a file or send data to a Splunk account with the Anypoint Splunk Connector, for example. To inspect or change a proxy application, import the proxy application in http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio[Anypoint Studio]. You can modify the application to perform additional functionality, provided essential structures remain in place. This section shows skeletal XML examples of several types of proxy applications having the essential structures.

To inspect the essential structures of a proxy application:

. After setting up a proxy using API Manager, in the Status area, click one of the *Download proxy* options.
+
. In Studio, select *File* > *Import*.
. In the Import dialog, expand the *Mule* node, and select *Anypoint Studio Generated Deployable Archive (.zip)*. Click *Next*.
. Navigate to a proxy zip file that you downloaded from API Manager.
. Click *Finish*.

You can now edit the proxy application.

=== Handling Domains Linked to the Proxy

After editing the proxy, you can export the project and then deploy it either on-premises or to CloudHub. API Gateway Runtime 1.3 - 2.x has a domain named api-gateway. In Mule 3.8.0, due to the unification of API Gateway Runtime with Mule Runtime 3.8.0 and several usability issues, the api-gateway domain has been removed. If you installed the link:/api-manager/api-gateway-domain[api-gateway domain] and linked the proxy to it, you are exporting and deploying only the proxy app. When deployed to production, the app relies on the domain, if there is one, that exists in that environment.

The following sections introduce the anatomy of the automatically generated proxy applications for a REST API. The anatomy of a SOAP proxy is similar.

=== Anatomy of a REST Proxy

This section describes the structure of a REST proxy for an API that you can set up in API Manager. From this structure, you can add additional functionality – to log data, for example. 

A proxy abstracts the API to a layer that can be managed by API Manager. A proxy for a REST API should meet the following criteria:

* Accepts incoming service calls from applications and routes them to the URI of the target API.
* Copies any message headers from the service call and passes them along to the API.
* Avoids passing internal Mule headers both to the API and back to the requester. 
* Captures message headers from the API response and attaches them to the response message.
* Routes the response to the application that made the service call.

When importing the proxy for the API into Studio 5.x and earlier, the project is linked to a *domain* project named `api-gateway`. Studio 5.x and earlier creates a domain project if necessary. The domain project is identical to the domain that exists in CloudHub and in an API Gateway On-Premises by default. Match the production deployment conditions when deploying an app to the Anypoint Studio 5.x server. If you modify the domain on the API Gateway on-prem installation, replicate the changes on the domain that exists in Studio 5.x or earlier. This domain project contains the `<http:listener-config` statement that the Mule flow requires.

In the API project, configure the property placeholders in the configuration in the `mule-app.properties` file, which you can find in the Package Explorer under `src/main/app`.

If an API requires HTTPS communication as shown in the HTTPS example or returns internal API URLs as part of the response, additional configuration might be required.

The downloaded file is a deployable proxy application. If needed, modify the downloaded zip file to adjust for port conflicts, use shared connector resources, or include custom code for logic that you want to add to the proxy. Deploy the proxy application. After deployment, the yellow circle in the status indicator turns green.
