= Accessing APIs
:keywords: api, portal, sla, oauth

You can make information about APIs you develop in Anypoint Platform public or available to certain users. You can extend privileges to individuals or to the general public to call your API. You use your organization's Developer Portal or link:/api-manager/engaging-users-of-your-api[create your own portal] for your API using API Portal tools.

API link:/access-management/[access management] roles and permissions include Portals Viewer and Portal Viewer for accessing the Developer Portal ro an  API Portal.

== Accessing the Developer Portal

You can access your organization's Developer Portal by using the name of your organization in the following URL:

`http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/\{yourorgdomain}/#/portals`

API Portals listed on the Developer Portal that are Public or to which you have been granted Portal Viewer access are visible. You can browse the portals alphabetically, or search for APIs according to name, version, or tags. +

== Accessing API Portals

To access the portal for an API, click the name or version number of the API.

An API Owner determines the content of their API Portal. Typically, you see documentation for the API and links to resources, such as an API Console. If the API you are browsing is implemented with RAML, you can use the API Console to explore the different calls and responses.

If you are browsing an API Portal for an API that already has an API URL set up by its API Owners, you see *Request API Access* at the top of the API. If the API is public, requesting API access has no effect. Just use the API; otherwise, click *Request API Access* and fill in the dialog. If you have previously registered an application for any API in the Developer Portal, that application appears in your drop-down menu. If you are registering an API for the first time, click *New Application*.

== Registering an Application

When you register a new application, API Manager prompts you to provide key information about your application: *Name*, *Description*, *Application URL*, and *Redirect URI*. If your organization is signed up to use PingFederate for identity management, you are also prompted to select an *OAuth Grant Type*. Your contact information is requested in the event the owner needs to migrate your application to a new version of the API, for example. If the API has link:/api-manager/defining-sla-tiers[SLA tiers], select one of them. Click *Request Access*. If the API does not define SLA tiers, or if the SLA tier you select is configured for automatic approval, the "Your API access request has been approved" message displays. If the access request requires manual approval, wait for the API owner to grant your request.

Provide the information and click *Submit*.

== Accessing Your Application Client ID and Client Secret

After you have registered an application, you can access application information from the *My Applications* tab in the Developer Portal. Log in to see your application information, which is only visible to you. My Applications provides a unique client ID and client secret for your application, which you need to pass your API calls for APIs that are protected with policies. Included in My Applications is a list of the APIs your application is currently registered to use.

To edit the details of your application, click the pencil icon next to your application name.

== Changing SLA Tiers

The following options describe the various ways that you and/or an API Owner can change the SLA tier that your application is contracted to use.

* If you requested access to a tier and have not yet been approved for that tier, you can reapply for access to a different tier and your request for access is automatically updated to the new tier.
* If you have been approved for a tier, you can reapply for access to a different tier. If the new tier requires manual approval, you need to wait for the API Owner to change your tier per your request.
* If you were previously approved for an SLA tier and your access to that tier was revoked,Â you can reapply for access to a tier. The API Owner can then restore your access and adjust the tier.
* If you were approved for an SLA tier and that tier is deprecated by the API Owner, you can apply for access to a non-deprecated tier. The API Owner can then change your tier per your request.
* The API Owner can also change your tier without a change request from you.

== Accessing APIs Protected by PingFederate OAuth Token Enforcement

When you work in an organization that uses PingFederate for identity management, you need to supply additional information to develop your application. Register your application on the Anypoint Platform to obtain a client ID and client secret from PingFederate, and work with your Organization Administrator to get necessary OAuth information.

When you register applications for access to APIs in a federated organization, you need to provide an *OAuth Grant Type*, *Application URL*, and **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI**.
