= To Deprecate an API Version (Latest)

While transitioning consumers of your API to an updated version, you can prevent developers from signing up for access to your old API version. As an API administrator, you mark an API as deprecated to remove the invitation for developers to request access from the portal page. Existing application contracts remain active but no new contracts can be created for that API version. Deprecated APIs have an indicator in any location where they appear showing they are deprecated. A badge in search results indicates that the version is deprecated.

. In Anypoint Platform, click API Manager.
. In API Administration, click the API version or instance link.
. Select Deprecate from the Actions dropdown.
+
The Deprecated tag appears on the version information page for the version or instance. The Deprecate Version on Actions changes to Undeprecate Version.
