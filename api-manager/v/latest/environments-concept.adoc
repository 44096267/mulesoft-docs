= About Environments in API Manager (New)

The support for environments in strategic components of Anypoint Platform eliminates the need to construct version names to reflect an environment. Restricting access to and managing environments is also simplified. When you navigate to API Manager, you see the environment control bearing the name of your default environment on the upper left. In this example, Sandbox is the default environment:

When you click the environment control, a list of your environments appears. Legacy APIs and others that you haven't associated with an environment, such as an API you create in Design Center, publish to Exchange, and set up to manage from Exchange are unclassified. You need to classify an API to manage it.

To give users access to an API, you need to grant the user permission to the environment.

... permissions TBD
