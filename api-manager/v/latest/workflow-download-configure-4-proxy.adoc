= Workflow: Download and Configure a Mule 4 Proxy (Nov 2017)

In Mule 4 Early Access, API Manager does _not_ generate proxies automatically. You need to download the proxy and modify it. In this workflow, you set up the API by putting an asset in place in Exchange, or by designing and publishing an API to Exchange. You manage the API from API Manager. Next, you download the Mule 4 proxy. Finally, you modify the proxy.
