= To Access APIs Protected by OAuth Token Enforcement (Latest)

When you work in an organization that uses PingFederate, OpenID Connect, or OpenAM for identity management, you need to supply additional information to develop your application. Register your application on Anypoint Platform to obtain a client ID and client secret and register them in the federated orgnaization, and work with your organization administrator to get necessary OAuth information.

When you register applications for access to APIs in a federated organization, you need to provide an OAuth Grant Type, Application URL, and OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI.
