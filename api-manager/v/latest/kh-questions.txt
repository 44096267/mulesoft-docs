Questions

Do we still need to talk about the auto-discovery process. Why in API Manager. This should be covered in Studio docs. You can use the auto-discovery process to register and start a Mule app. 

Is this a true statement: API Manager can discover and register an API or Mule app deployed from Studio or Design Center without user intervention. 

In Import API From Exchange is API Specification Version the published or unpublished version in Design Center and API Version the published version in exchange?

Whats the definition of an Embedded type of API (vs a proxy).
