= About API Manager (Latest)
:keywords: api, manager, raml

API Manager is a component of Anypoint Platform for managing APIs. The latest API Manager is tightly integrated with the following tools:

* Design Center for creating the RAML structure of the API
+
The API design capabilities of Design Center replace the classic API Designer tool in Anypoint Platform.
+
* Exchange for storing and publishing API assets
+
Assets are components, such as API versions, templates, and connectors owned by MuleSoft or your organization.
+
* Studio for implementing the API 

Through the auto-discovery scheme, API Manager can track the API throughout the life cycle as you modify, version, deploy, govern, and publish it. 

API Manager manages APIs that reside in Exchange or imports the APIs in a ZIP file from the file system. The ZIP is an API object that you exported API Manager. You set up the API for RAML, HTTP, or WSDL management.

* RAML for REST APIs
+
Provide the REST API Markup Language source, which you can write using Design Center.
+
* HTTP for non-RAML REST APIs
+
Provide the URL of the inbound HTTP or HTTPS endpoint.
+
* WSDL for SOAP APIs
+
Provide the URL where Anypoint Platform can find Web Services Definition Language source.

// talk about naming, instances

After configuring the API, you can perform API management tasks:

* Governance
+
Applying policies and setting up SLA tiers
+
* Assigning permissions to the API environment
* Versioning
* Exporting an API
* Viewing API analytics
* Setting up API alerts
* Downloading an API proxy
* Ending the life of an API

// do not include -- deployment is temporary

////
From API Manager, you can deploy an API to a Mule Runtime that runs on a server, such as CloudHub in the public cloud. You can also deploy to a private cloud or hybrid. A hybrid deployment is an API deployed on a private server but having metadata processed in the public cloud. Apps request access to APIs in Exchange, as depicted in the following diagram.

As Organization Administrator or Environment Administrator, you can see and manage client applications registered to access your API.
