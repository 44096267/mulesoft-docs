= To Configure Auto-Discovery (New)

In Mule 4, the apiId and a reference to the API's main flow identify the API. The main flow is where the HTTP listener is defined. The apiId in Mule 4 replaces the API Name and API Version used to specify auto-discovery in releases before Mule 4. 

This procedure describes how to find the environment credentials and configure auto-discovery.

== Mule 4

This procedure assumes you created instances of an API version.

. On the API administration dashboard, expand the API version name to display the instances.

+
. Click an instance name.
+
The environment credentials, ID:Label (31429:Basic516) in this example appear:
+

. Use the following syntax for specifying the apiId:

`<api-gateway:autodiscovery apiId="${api.id}" flowRef="proxy" />`

== Studio 6 Configuration

To use API auto-discovery, first you need to pair Anypoint Studio with an Anypoint Platform organization by adding organization credentials to Studio *Preferences*. Next, you configure auto-discovery for each flow you want to manage using a global element. A Global Element contains the necessary information for registering an API to Anypoint Platform. Global Elements must then be referenced by one or more endpoints. Finally, you deploy the API project as a Mule application in Studio. API Manager discovers the API and registers it. The API appears on the API Administration page in Anypoint Platform for each flow you configure for auto-discovery.

*To configure and trigger auto-discovery*:

. In a browser, log in to Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click *Access Management*. Select *Organization*.
+
Select your Organization from the list.
+
The client ID and client secret appear.
+
. From the Anypoint Studio main menu, select *Anypoint Studio > Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Platform for APIs*.
+
The Preferences dialog for Anypoint Platform for APIs appears.
. Copy the client ID and client secret from step 2 to *Client Credentials*.
+

+
This action pairs Mule Runtime with your Anypoint Platform organization.
+
. Click *Validate* to verify that the pairing succeeds.
+
. Click OK.
. In Project Explorer, select the app. For example, select `api.xml` in `src/main/app` that you created in the APIkit tutorial.
. On the Global Elements tab on the canvas, click *Create*.
+

+
The *Choose Global Type* dialog appears.
+
. Select *Component configurations* > *API Autodiscovery*.
+
The Global Element Properties - API Autodiscovery dialog appears.
+
. Create a global element to declare the details of the API version you want Anypoint Platform to discover:
+
* In *API Name*, type an arbitrary name, for example `vending`.
+
If you are creating a new API, API Manager makes this name visible in Anypoint Platform.
+
* In *API Version*, type an arbitrary version identifier, for example `1.0development`.
+
Do not change the version name later in API Portal, as explained in link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery#best-practices["Best Practices"].
* In *Flow Name*, select the name of the flow in the API from the drop-down. Select the flow that you want to which you want to direct requests. For example, select `api-main`, the APIkit tutorial main flow.
* Check the option to automatically create an API if it doesn't exist.
* In *APIkit Router Configuration*, click api-config from the drop-down in the case of the APIkit tutorial.
+
This configuration is not used by API Manager.
+
* In *Description*, write some documentation about the API.
+

+
* Click OK.
+
. In Project Explorer, right-click the app, `api.xml` in this example, and select *Run As > Mule Application*.
+
In a few moments, the API appears on the API Administration page of Anypoint Platform.
