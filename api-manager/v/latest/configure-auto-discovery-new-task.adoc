= To Configure Auto-Discovery (New)

In Mule 4, the apiId and a reference to the API's main flow identify the API. The main flow is where the HTTP listener is defined. The apiId in Mule 4 replaces the API Name and API Version used to specify auto-discovery in releases before Mule 4. 

This procedure describes how to find the environment credentials and configure auto-discovery.

== Mule 4

This procedure assumes you created instances of an API version.

. On the API administration dashboard, expand the API version name to display the instances.

+
. Click an instance name.
+
The environment credentials, ID:Label (31429:Basic516) in this example appear:
+

. Use the following syntax for specifying the apiId:

`<api-gateway:autodiscovery apiId="${api.id}" flowRef="proxy" />`

== Studio 6 Configuration

To use API auto-discovery:

* Create an API in Design Center for each flow you plan to create in a Mule app.
* Publish the APIs in Exchange.
* Pair Anypoint Studio with an Anypoint Platform organization by adding organization credentials to Studio Preferences. 
* Configure auto-discovery for each flow you want to manage using a global element. 
+
A Global Element contains the necessary information for registering an API to Anypoint Platform. Global Elements must then be referenced by one or more endpoints. 
* Deploy the API project as a Mule application in Studio. 

API Manager discovers the API for each flow you configure for auto-discovery.

*To configure and trigger auto-discovery*:

. In a browser, log in to Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click Access Management. Select Organization.
+
Select your Organization from the list.
+
The client ID and client secret appear.
+
. From the Anypoint Studio main menu, select *Anypoint Studio > Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Anypoint Platform for APIs*.
+
The Preferences dialog for Anypoint Platform for APIs appears.
. Copy the client ID and client secret from step 2 to Client Credentials.
+

+
This action pairs Mule Runtime with your Anypoint Platform organization.
+
. Click Validate to verify that the pairing succeeds.
+
. Click OK.
. In Project Explorer, select the app. For example, select `api.xml` in `src/main/app` that you created in the APIkit tutorial.
. On the Global Elements tab on the canvas, click Create.
+

+
The Choose Global Type dialog appears.
+
. Select Component Configurations > API Autodiscovery.
+
The Global Element Properties - API Autodiscovery dialog appears.
+
. Create a global element to declare the details of the API version you want Anypoint Platform to discover:
+
* In API Name, type an arbitrary name, for example `vending`.
+
If you are creating a new API, API Manager makes this name visible in Anypoint Platform.
+
* In API Version, type an arbitrary version identifier, for example `1.0`.
+
* In Flow Name, select the name of the flow in the API from the drop-down. Select the flow that you want to which you want to direct requests. For example, select `api-main`, the APIkit tutorial main flow.
* Check the option to automatically create an API if it doesn't exist.
* In APIkit Router Configuration, click api-config from the drop-down in the case of the APIkit tutorial.
+
This configuration is not used by API Manager.
+
* In Description, write some documentation about the API.
+
image:auto-disc-conf2.png[auto-disc-conf2,height=422,width=439]
+
* Click OK.
+
. In Project Explorer, right-click the app, `api.xml` in this example, and select Run As > Mule Application.
+
In a few moments, the API appears in the Unclassified environment in API Manager.
