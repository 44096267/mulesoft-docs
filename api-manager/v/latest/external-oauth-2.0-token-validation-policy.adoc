= OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy
:keywords: oauth, raml, token, validation, policy

The OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy enforces the following interaction between the OAuth 2.0 provider, API, and client application:

image::oauth+policy1.png[oauth+policy1,height=300,width=377]

. The client application requests a token. The request based on an OAuth grant must occur before any request can be sent to the API.
. The OAuth Provider returns a token, which can specify a scope of access using the link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-23[`scope` request parameter]. 
. The client application sends a request to the API, which includes the received token either as an authentication header or a query parameter.
. The OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy intercepts this request and validates the token against the validation URL of the OAuth provider. If scopes are provided in the policy, the policy also assures that the token is valid for those specific scopes.
. If the token is properly validated, it is whitelisted and kept on record until expiration. Any further requests that contain this token aren't validated against the OAuth provider. If the token isn't properly validated, a `403` error message is returned to the client application.
. If the token is valid, the request is forwarded to the API.
. The API responds to the client application.

The OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Using External Provider policy supports HTTPS communication for configuring a single OAuth provider for multiple APIs. One of the following runtime versions are required:

* Mule 3.8.0 runtime
* API Gateway 2.0 runtime or later

On earlier versions of API Gateway runtime, you can apply the link:/api-manager/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Provider and OAuth Token Enforcement Policies].

== Prerequisites

To configure an API to use the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy, familiarity with link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-secure-token-service[OAuth 2.0] is recommended. You need to be an Organization Administrator or API Version Owner for the API version that you want to manage using policies.

=== Applying OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Validation

To apply the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy, you need to deploy an link:/api-manager/building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application[external OAuth 2.0 provider app] separately. The provider application can be deployed anywhere, on premises or in the cloud. Its OAuth component must be configured with the Client ID and Client Secret of the Anypoint Platform organization in which the managed API is registered.

This external OAuth 2.0 provider application must be built with Mule Runtime version 3.8 or later or with API Gateway 2.0 or later runtime.

=== Prerequisites for RAML APIs

If your API is defined using RAML (recommended), define link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#oauth-20[RAML securitySchemes] for OAuth 2.0. See the RAML 1.0 link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/release-notes/raml-1-early-access-support[early access document]. Before configuring OAuth policies in the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page], determine any prerequisites and requirements determined by your securitySchemes definition in your RAML file.

==== OAuth Dance URIs

Within the RAML securitySchemes definition, include URIs for the authorization and access token. 

* `authorizationUri` 
+
Example: https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/authorize
+
* `accessTokenUri`
+
Example: https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/access_token

Set mule-app.properties. For example:

* host = 0.0.0.0
* port = `${http.port}`
* HTTP endpoint: `http.port=8083`
* HTTPS endpoint: `https.port=8082`


==== Grant Types

You specify grant types in RAML securitySchemes. The RAML syntax for the authorizationGrants setting is:

----
settings:
   authorizationUri: https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/authorize
   accessTokenUri:  https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/access_token
   authorizationGrants: [authorization_code, password, client_credentials, implicit]
----

The following table shows the mapping of the RAML grant types to the grant type names in the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation policy configuration. 

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Authorization Grant Types Defined in RAML Definition |Equivalent Authorization Grant Type to Enable in the OAuth Provider Policy |Supported in embedded APIkit Console?
|`[implicit]` |Implicit |Yes
|`[client_credentials]` |Client Credentials |No
|`[password]` |Resource Owner Password Credentials |No
|`[authorization_code]` |Authorization Code |Yes
|===

== Configuring the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy

Before applying this policy, modify the API RAML code to support OAuth authentication and deploy an OAuth provider application, as previously described.

Configure the following optional scopes and required token validation endpoint URL for the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation policy:

* *Scopes*
+
In the optional Scopes field, you can enter a space-separated list of supported OAuth link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-23[scopes], such as `read write`. Specify scopes that match one or more of the scopes defined on the referenced OAuth 2.0 Provider application. If the OAuth 2.0 Provider application defines no scopes, leave this field blank. If you plan to use API Console to simulate the API, leave scopes blank and apply the CORS policy.
+
* *Access Token Validation Endpoint URL*
+
The URL of the external OAuth 2.0 Provider used for granting the access token, for example `https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/validate`
+

== Using an API Protected by OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider

Depending on the OAuth grant type you want to use, the OAuth Provider application might expose two or three endpoints:

* `/authorize`: provides an access code for later obtaining a token
* `/access_token`: returns a new token
* `/validate`: verifies a token's validity

Depending on the grant type being used, you might have to use only `/access_token` , both `/authorize` and `/access_token`, or to none of them. Obtain the token before attempting to send requests to the API that's protected by the policy. Include the token in all requests sent to the API using a query parameter or an authorization header:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Places to include Token |Example |Notes
|Query parameter |`?access_token=123` |Included as part of the URI
|Authorization header |`Authorization:Bearer 123` |The header consists of a key:value pair, where Authorization is the key and the value is composed as follows:
 `"Bearer" + <space> + <token, for example, 123>`
|===

When a request is received, the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy sends a request to the `/validate` URL of the OAuth provider to ensure the token's validity.

== Testing OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider

You can test an API that has the policy applied using the API Notebook and API Console after registering an API within a portal in the platform.

== Obtaining User Credentials

In some cases, you might want to access information about which externally authenticated users are using an API. To do so, place the following script between the inbound and outbound endpoints of the proxy. The script executes after the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy enforcement:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<expression-component>
    message.outboundProperties.put('X-Authenticated-userid', _muleEvent.session.securityContext.authentication.principal.username)
</expression-component>
----

This script stores the username in the mule message as an outbound-property named `X-Authenticated-userid`. The HTTP Connector, used to generate the proxy's output, transforms any outbound properties that reach it into HTTP message headers. In this way the message that reaches the API after passing through your proxy includes an HTTP header named `X-Authenticated-userid`, containing the username.

You can modify this code to change the name of the header being created.
