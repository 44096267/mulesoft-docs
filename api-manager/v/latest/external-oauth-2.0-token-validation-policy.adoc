= OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy
:keywords: oauth, raml, token, validation, policy

RFC 6749 specifies that the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. The OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy enforces this interaction between the OAuth 2.0 provider, API, and client application:

. The client application requests a token from the provider.
. The provider returns a token. 
. The client application sends a request to the API, including the token either as an authentication header or a query parameter.
. The OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy intercepts this request and validates the token. 
. If the token is properly validated, it is whitelisted and kept on record until expiration. Any further requests that contain this token aren't validated against the OAuth provider. If the token isn't properly validated, a `403` error message is returned to the client application.
. If the token is valid, the request is forwarded to the API.
. The API responds to the client application.

You can get a hands-on perspective of this process, commonly called the OAuth dance, by following the step-by-step procedure of link:/api-manager/building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application[building, running, and testing] the custom OAuth provider.

== Prerequisites

To apply the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy to an API, you need access to a deployed link:/api-manager/building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application[external OAuth 2.0 provider]. The provider can run anywhere, on premises or in the cloud. The provider must be configured with the client ID and client secret of the Anypoint Platform organization in which you register the managed API. For example, when you link:/api-manager/building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application#deploying-the-provider-to-a-remote-server[deploy the custom OAuth2 provider] developed by MuleSoft Consulting, you set the client ID and client secret in step 6 using *Settings* > *Properties* in Runtime Manager.

=== Requirements for RAML APIs

If your API is defined using RAML (recommended), define link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#oauth-20[RAML securitySchemes] for OAuth 2.0 as shown in the example of link:/api-manager/building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application#using-and-testing-oauth2[testing the custom provider] from MuleSoft Consulting. Within the RAML securitySchemes definition, you include URIs for the authorization and access token as shown in the example. 

You specify grant types in RAML securitySchemes. The following example RAML syntax shows the authorizationGrants setting:

----
settings:
   authorizationUri: https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/authorize
   accessTokenUri:  https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/access_token
   authorizationGrants: [authorization_code, password, client_credentials, implicit]
----

The following table shows the mapping of the RAML grant types to the grant type names in the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation policy configuration. 

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Authorization Grant Types Defined in RAML Definition |Equivalent Authorization Grant Type to Enable in the OAuth Provider Policy |Supported in embedded APIkit Console?
|`[implicit]` |Implicit |Yes
|`[client_credentials]` |Client Credentials |No
|`[password]` |Resource Owner Password Credentials |No
|`[authorization_code]` |Authorization Code |Yes
|===

== Applying the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy

To apply the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy to an API, configure the optional scopes and required token validation endpoint URL as follows:

* *Scopes*
+
In the optional Scopes field, you can enter a space-separated list of supported OAuth link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-23[scopes], such as `read write`. Specify scopes that match one or more of the scopes defined on the referenced OAuth 2.0 Provider application. If the OAuth 2.0 Provider application defines no scopes, leave this field blank. If you plan to use API Console to simulate the API, leave scopes blank and apply the CORS policy.
+
* *Access Token Validation Endpoint URL*
+
In the required *Access Token validation endpoiong url* field, you must enter the URL of the external OAuth 2.0 Provider used for granting the access token, for example `https://oauth2provider.cloudhub.io/validate`.

== Using an API Protected by OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider

Depending on the OAuth grant type you want to use, the OAuth Provider application might expose two or three endpoints:

* `/authorize`: provides an access code for later obtaining a token
* `/access_token`: returns a new token
* `/validate`: verifies a token's validity

Depending on the grant type being used, you might have to use only `/access_token` , both `/authorize` and `/access_token`, or neither of them. Obtain the token before attempting to send requests to the API protected by the policy. Include the token in all requests sent to the API using a query parameter or an authorization header as shown in the Postman example of link:/api-manager/building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application#using-and-testing-oauth2[using the custom OAuth2 provider] from MuleSoft Consulting. The folliwng table summarizes this usage:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Places to include Token |Example |Notes
|Query parameter |`?access_token=123` |Included as part of the URI
|Authorization header |`Authorization:Bearer 123` |The header consists of a key:value pair, where Authorization is the key and the value is composed as follows:
 `"Bearer" + <space> + <token, for example, 123>`
|===

When a request is received, the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy sends a request to the `/validate` URL of the OAuth provider to ensure the validity of the token.

== Testing OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider

You can test an API that has the policy applied using the API Notebook and API Console after registering an API within a portal in the platform.

== Obtaining User Credentials

In some cases, you might want to access information about which externally authenticated users are using an API. To do so, place the following script between the inbound and outbound endpoints of the proxy. The script executes after the OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy enforcement:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<expression-component>
    message.outboundProperties.put('X-Authenticated-userid', _muleEvent.session.securityContext.authentication.principal.username)
</expression-component>
----

This script stores the username in the mule message as an outbound-property named `X-Authenticated-userid`. The HTTP Connector, used to generate the proxy's output, transforms any outbound properties that reach it into HTTP message headers. In this way the message that reaches the API after passing through your proxy includes an HTTP header named `X-Authenticated-userid`, containing the username.

You can modify this code to change the name of the header being created.
