= API Designer (Archive)

The Design Center release unified the setup and design of an API for governance in API Manager. If you're a new user, you can use Design Center instead of Add New API in API Manager to set up an API in API Manager. You can use the RAML editor in Design Center instead of API Designer. Depending on your entitlements, or if you are a new user, the legacy API Designer and Add New API in API Manager might not be visible in Anypoint Platform.

If you have existing designs in API Designer, continue using the API Designer. For new API design, Design Center is recommended. The advantages of Design Center are discussed in "About Design Center."
