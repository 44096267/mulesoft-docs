= API Designer (in API Manager 1.14.4)

If you have APIs in API Manager and a subscription to API Manager and Analytics, you can continue using API Manager 1.14.4 to add APIs to Anypoint Platform. You also continue using API Designer as your RAML editor:

If you have existing designs in API Designer, continue using the API Designer. For new API design, Design Center is recommended. The Crowd Release is required for using the RAML editor in Design Center.
