= API Designer (in API Manager 1.14.4)

The Crowd release unifies the setup and design of an API for governance in API Manager. If you have the Crowd release can use the Design Center to author and update RAML specifications. If you have the Crowd release, API Designer might not be visible in Anypoint Platform > API Manager. If you do not have the Crowd release, you must use API Manager > API Designer.

If you have existing designs in API Designer, continue using the API Designer. For new API design, Design Center is recommended. The advantages of Design Center are discussed in "About Design Center."
