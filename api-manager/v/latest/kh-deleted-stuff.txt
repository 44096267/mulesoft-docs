= About Anypoint Platform

Anypoint Platform uses Mule as its core runtime engine. You can use Anypoint Platform on the internet or private cloud. If you don't already have an account, you can sign up to use Anypoint Platform on the internet:

`+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com+`

If you set up your own account on the internet, you are assigned the Organization Administrators role. If your organization uses Anypoint Platform on a private cloud, obtain permissions and roles from the Anypoint Platform administrator for your organization.

You can use the Anypoint Platform command line interface (CLI) to interact with API Manager and perform other Anypoint Platform operations.

The life cycle of an API involves setup and deployment, management, and engaging users on an API Portal. The following diagram depicts the workflow, color-coding tasks as follows:

* Administrative task (orange)
* API or app developer task (blue)

= About Deploying an API

You can deploy an API implementation to a Mule Runtime that runs on a server, such as CloudHub in the public cloud. You can also deploy to a private cloud or hybrid. A hybrid deployment is an API deployed on a private server but having metadata processed in the public cloud. Regardless of the server location, each server belongs to an environment, such as Design, Test, or Production. Servers are defined in business groups and each business group can have multiple environments.
