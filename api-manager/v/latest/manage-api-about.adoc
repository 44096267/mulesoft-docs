= About Managing an API

After logging into your Anypoint Platform account, and opening API Manager, you are in API Administration in Anypoint Platform. A list of the APIs you have registered in the platform appears. An API registered in API Manager belongs to a business group and can have multiple API versions. As a member of the API Creators or Organization Administrators role, you can register new APIs or add new versions to existing APIs. An API Versions Owner can access the API version details pages for the versions they own.

On the API Administration page, Add New API imports an existing API or adds a definition. The API Administration page also lists the names and versions of the APIs you define or import. Hover over and click the version name area to show details on the left panel of the API Administration page:

To start an API management task, click a version name. A page of controls for performing API management tasks on the selected version appears on the API version details page:

You can share resources in an organization and perform API management tasks. After deploying an API registered in API Manager, you can protect your API using policies. Available policies for an API appear only after you deploy the API. 

Click `>` to get the status and description of a policy in the list of available policies.

As an API Versions Owner, you typically add policies and SLA tiers to the API that you deploy by proxy. The policies combined with an SLA definition restricts access to the API from applications registered by tier to make API calls. 

You can publish APIs on a portal in Anypoint Platform to expose the APIs to users. API Manager sends an email notification to you when someone requests access to an API on the portal. 

You can set API alerts to receive notification of events related to the API, such as excessive blocked requests on an API.
