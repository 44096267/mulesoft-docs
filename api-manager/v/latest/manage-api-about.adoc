= About Managing an API

After logging into your Anypoint Platform account, the API Administration page appears when you click API Manager on the Anypoint Platform home page. The API Administration page is an administrative view of the APIs currently registered in the platform. From this view, API Creators and Organization Administrators can register new APIs or add new versions to existing APIs, and an API Versions Owner can access the API version details pages for the versions they own.

On the API Administration page, Add New API imports an existing API or adds a definition, typically just the API name and version. The API definition, written in RAML, includes the following things:

* An optional [baseURI node] at the root of the RAML document
* API resources, for example the collection of all customers or a specific customer
* HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowed on each resource
* The representation of the request and response messages for each method, such as `GET /customer/1 -> response: application/json`

The API Administration page also lists the names and versions of the APIs you define or import. Hover over and click the version name area to show details on the left panel of the API Administration page:

To start an API management task, click a version name. A page of controls for performing API management tasks on the selected version appears on the API version details page:

Using controls on this page, you can link:/access-management/managing-your-account[share resources in an organization] and perform API management tasks.
