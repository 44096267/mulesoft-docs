= About WSDL Proxies (New)

A Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) proxy takes advantage of Mule Runtime capabilities and protects your web service. API Manager handles a WSDL proxy as follows:

* X-Forwarded-For headers are included in request through the proxy.
* Headers received by the proxy are sent to the implementation API, except the ones that Mule includes: X-MULE-SESSION, X-MULE-ENCODING, and so on.
* If a request to the proxy canâ€™t be fulfilled because of a timeout problem, the client receives a response with status code: 504.
* API Manager gathers and reports analytics if you configure auto-discovery in the API. 
* API Manager governs the WSDL proxy if you apply policies. 
* Errors related to out-of-the-box policies are sent as soap:fault messages.
