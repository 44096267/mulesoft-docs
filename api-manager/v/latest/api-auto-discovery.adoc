= About Auto-Discovery (New and Classic)

API auto-discovery is the mechanism to manage an API from API Manager by pairing the deployed application to an API created on the platform. Auto-discovery plays a key role in API governance through policies. Critical to the auto-discovery process is providing one of the following types of credentials, depending on the API Manager version you use, correctly:

* apiId (New API Manager)
* API name and version (Classic API Manager)

To connect to an organization from Mule Runtime:

* If the API is registered in the latest API Manager, you need to provide the client id and client secret of the organization's environment.
* If the API is registered in the classic API Manager, you need to provide the client id and client secret of the organization's business group. 

These credentials are set as follows:

* Deploy from Studio
+
Studio 6.0: Add organization credentials to Studio Preferences. For more information, see the Studio 6 documentation (link below).
+
* Deploy the API through API Manager or Runtime Manager
+
Auto-discovery is configured automatically
+
* Deploy from the Mule command line
+
You configure auto-discovery in `$MULE_HOME/conf/wrapper.conf` as described in the next topic.
+
* Deploy some other way
+
Set system properties in Runtime Manager. In the property settings using the following names:
+
** anypoint.platform.client_id={your client ID}
** anypoint.platform.client_secret={your client secret}

== No Support for Auto-Discovery (Studio 7)
