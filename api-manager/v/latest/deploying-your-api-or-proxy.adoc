= Deploying an API or Proxy Overview
:keywords: api, proxy, gateway, deploy

To use Anypoint Platform features, such as link:/api-manager/using-policies[API Manager policies], link:/access-management[access management], and link:/runtime-manager[runtime management], you need to use API Manager to perform the initial deployment. Later you can redeploy the API using API Manager or link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager].

You can deploy an API if it meets the following criteria:

* The API is registered in API Manager. 
+
An API can be registered in API Manager by running a project in Anypoint Studio using link:/api-manage/api-auto-discovery[auto-discovery] or by link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-an-api[setting up the API] in API Manager.
+
* The API is runnable.
+
You can use link:/api-manager/designing-your-api#accessing-api-designer[API Designer], AnyPoint Studio, or Mule runtime to run and debug code prior to deployment.

To deploy an API to an on-premise Mule runtime, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/downloading-and-starting-mule-esb[download] and install Mule runtime before proceeding. 

To deploy an API to an on-premise API Gateway runtime, link:/api-manager/configuring-an-api-gateway[install and configure] that Gateway runtime, and then deploy manually. 

To deploy to CloudHub, no configuration is required.

== Deployment Process

The first step in the deployment process is to configure an endpoint from the API version details page.

Click *Configure endpoint*.

The *Configure endpoint* dialog presents the following options for deploying an API:

* Basic endpoint
+
Use a basic endpoint if you create your API outside API Manager, for example, you created the API using Mule ESB. You don't need a proxy in this case.
+
* Endpoint with a proxy
+
By default, *Endpoint with a proxy* is selected.

=== Using a Basic Endpoint

If you choose *Basic endpoint* in the *Configure Endpoint*, select the link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy#about-the-type-and-implementation-uri-options[type of endpoint settings]. 

In *Implementation URI*, accept the default based on the baseUri from the RAML definition, or enter one of the other link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy#about-the-type-and-implementation-uri-options[URI options].

=== Using an Endpoint with a Proxy

Use an endpoint with a proxy to deploy an API registered in API Manager, as described in link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy[Setting Up and Deploying a Proxy].
