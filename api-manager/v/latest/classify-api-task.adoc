= To Classify an API (Latest)

APIs you migrate from an earlier to the latest API Manager reside in the unclassified environment. Also, any API is classified that you didn't associate with an environment prior to moving to the latest API Manager. For example, an API is unclassified when you publish to Exchange from Design Center and then set up in API Manager to manage from Exchange. You need to classify any unclassified APIs to govern or otherwise manage the APIs.

. In API Manager, click the environment control, labeled SANDBOX, in this example:

If you do not see a suitable environment for classification of the API, create one in Asset Management.

. Click Classify.
. In Target Environment, select the environment for the API from the list of environments available to you. For example, select Test.
. In Instance Name, type a unique instance name. For example, type abc-api-1
+
In environments, APIs can have more than a single instance. Therefore, an instance name is required to uniquely identify it.
