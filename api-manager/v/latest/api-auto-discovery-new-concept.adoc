= About Auto-Discovery (New)

API auto-discovery is the mechanism to manage an API from API Manager by pairing the deployed application to an API created on the platform. API Management includes tracking, enforcing policies if you apply any, and reporting API analytics. Critical to the auto-discovery process is identifying the API by providing the apiId.

To connect to an organization from Mule Runtime, if the API is managed by API Manager, the client id and client secret of the organization's environment are configured automatically.

== No Support for Auto-Discovery (Studio 7)

If the API is not managed by API Manager, you cannot use Studio to register the API in API Manager in this release. The auto-discovery element is not supported in Studio 7.0. In order to connect and to manage an API from Studio, you need to manually add the element to your Studio 7 applications.
