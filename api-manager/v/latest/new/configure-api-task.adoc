= To Configure an API Endpoint

You can set up one of the following types of management:

* Direct management of the endpoint: Basic endpoint
+
Set up a basic endpoint.
+
* Management by proxy: Endpoint with proxy

If you do not plan to deploy the API on a public site, for example, and are not worried about attacks on your server, you configure the basic endpoint. Set up an endpoint with a proxy application to shield the API from attacks on the server.
