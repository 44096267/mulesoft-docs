migration: https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/apim-migration-tool

Are we going to continue to talk about Jetty endpoints in the docs, or is the audience for this info relative to our new products too small?

Is this statement about Add Consumer Endpoint on API Administration {version} -Settings correct? "Add the link to the endpoint that listens for incoming messages."

I can't you promote an API.

I exported an api from DC (apiname.zip) and could not import it into API Manager: Error The supported file types for import are .bundle or .zip.

pls tell me about .bundle again? Which users are trying to import a .bundle?



hi sorry to ask again, but i'm not sure i got this right. what files does apim accept for importing: API exported from API Manager (crowd and legacy?), API exported from Studio (7 only, right?), and ... what else? is the error message about .bundle/.zip going to be in the released product? if so, pls tell me (again) where does .bundle come from? (edited)

is an api exported from design center supposed to work (no luck getting the stgxdr DC export to work)?

Hi Kris.. probably the reason of that confusion is the difficulty on our products to differentiate an API Speficiation (also commonly known as RAML) versus an API  object of API Manager
The API Object exported from API Manager view, can only be imported as an API object in API manager, and has to be either crowd or legacy meaning that if it was exported in crowd, MUST be imported in crowd if it was exported in legacy (previous crowd), MUST be imported in legacy now a different thing is the API Specification (also commonly known as RAML): (edited)


Normally you export it from API Designer (in legacy API manager - previous CROWD) and can be imported on API Designer
I am not sure about new Design Center (Part of crowd release).. I need to check.. but for sure it supports exporting of an API Specification (RAML) and importing an API Specification



hi guys--help me improve the Design Center doc to explain the drop-down in the Export API dialog. why would you export to Project.zip, OAS.json, OAS.yaml (see screenshot 1)? Is this for future use? what's the difference between exporting project.zip and Q3SaleTracking.zip (see screenshot 2)? will u be able to import the zip file into API Manager (nov 18 release)?

why would you export to Project.zip, OAS.json, OAS.yaml (see screenshot 1)?
For use in other tool and take your files out of designer. You could export to then work with your files in your local machine ( for instance API Workbench). The OAS json/yaml could be used in other tool that uses OAS instead of RAML. The use case is not really fixed, the idea is to get your files out to use then somewhere else.

> what’s the difference between exporting project.zip and Q3SaleTracking.zip (see screenshot 2)?

The first combo box (“Project .zip”, OAS .json, OAS .yaml) its intended to select the output type or format. Then second input is to enter the name of the exported file. Maybe this is not clear enough.

> will u be able to import the zip file into API Manager (nov 18 release)?
Not that I know (edited)
