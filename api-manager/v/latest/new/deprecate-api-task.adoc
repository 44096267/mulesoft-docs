= To Deprecate an API Version

While transitioning consumers of your API to an updated version, you can prevent developers from signing up for access to your old API version. As an API administrator, you mark an API as deprecated to remove the Request API Access from the portal page. Existing application contracts remain active but no new contracts can be created for that API version. Deprecated APIs have an indicator in any location where they appear showing they are deprecated. A badge in search results indicates that the version is deprecated.

. In Anypoint Platform, click API Manager.
. In API Administration, click the API version link.
. Select Deprecate from the Actions dropdown.
+
The Deprecated tag appears on the version information page. The Deprecate Version on Actions changes to Undeprecate Version.
