= To Classify an API

An API appears in the API Manager in the unclassified environment if it wasn't classified prior to publication in API Manager. For example, if you publish an API from Design Center to API Manager, the API is unclassified. You need to classify an API to manage it.

. In API Manager, click the environment control, labeled SANDBOX, in this example:

. In Target Environment, select the environment for the API from the list of environments available to you. For example, select Test.
. In Instance Name, type a unique instance name.

In environments, APIs can have more than a single instance. Therefore, an instance name is required to uniquely identify it.
