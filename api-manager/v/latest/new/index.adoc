API Manager is a component of Anypoint Platform for managing and deploying API to Mule. API Manager acquires APIs to manage in these ways:

//update link to API Platform API

* An export of an API from Design Center to API Manager
* Setting up a reference to an API in Exchange
* Importing an API from the file system
+
The ZIP is an export from Design Center, Exchange, or API Manager.
+
* Programmatically exporting an API to API Manager using an API, such as the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/apis/11197/versions/126378/pages/181952[API Platform API].

Acquiring and setting up an API in API Manager includes classifying the API in an environment if the acquired API is unclassified. The following diagram shows the set up process:

From API Manager, you can deploy an API to a Mule Runtime that runs on a server, such as CloudHub in the public cloud. You can also deploy to a private cloud or hybrid. A hybrid deployment is an API deployed on a private server but having metadata processed in the public cloud. Apps request access to APIs in Exchange, as depicted in the following diagram.

As Organization Administrator, you can see and manage client applications registered to access your API.
