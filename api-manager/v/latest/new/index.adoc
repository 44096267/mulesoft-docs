From API Manager, you can deploy an API to a Mule Runtime that runs on a server, such as CloudHub in the public cloud. You can also deploy to a private cloud or hybrid. A hybrid deployment is an API deployed on a private server but having metadata processed in the public cloud.  Apps request access to APIs in Exchange, as depicted in the following diagram.
