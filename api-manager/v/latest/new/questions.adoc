Why is it Manage API on sandbox and Import API on unclassified?

Difference between Manage API From Exchange in sandbox and Import API from Exchange in classified

What kind of zip can it import

What's the difference between promote api from environ and classify


Sandbox--click version
When you click a version in Sandbox mode and go to admin details page and fill in add consumer endpoint, what does this error mean:

Not Found
Close
"Endpoint" could not be found using "APIId:29818"

you see stuff from Exchange in API Configure and Deployment Configuration

Settings: API Configuration 
          Deployment Configuration done

One of the dialogs still has Save and Deploy, but will you really be able to deploy from api manager?

Import API zip/bundle is what kind of zip/bundle (a zip from Studio/Designer/API Mgr or what)? What do you see after importing this?
