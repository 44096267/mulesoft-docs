The software doesn't seem to be complete yet. True? Do I have an account that can do everything possible with the software? My login is krishahnstxdr. 

Why does the drop-down say Manage API from Exchange in the sandbox environment and Import API from Exchange on unclassified environment? Is there any difference?

Import API zip/bundle is what kind of zip/bundle (a zip from Studio/Designer/API Mgr or what)? What do you see after importing this? I have not been able to import a zip. 

What's the difference between promoting an api from environment and classifying an API?


Sandbox--click version
When you click a version in Sandbox mode and go to admin details page and fill in add consumer endpoint, what does this error mean:

Not Found
Close
"Endpoint" could not be found using "APIId:29818"

One of the dialogs still has Save and Deploy, but will you really be able to deploy from api manager?

On the web page that lists the Unclassified APIs, are the items on the hamburger menu going to change: Developer portal, Developer portal theme settings, Request API access terms & conditions, Portal terms & conditions?
