Are we going to continue to talk about Jetty endpoints in the docs, or is the audience for this info relative to our new products too small?

Is this statement about Add Consumer Endpoint on API Administration {version} -Settings correct? "Add the link to the endpoint the listens for incoming messages."

I exported an api from DC (apiname.zip) and could not import it into API Manager: Error The supported file types for import are .bundle or .zip.

pls tell me about .bundle again? Which users are trying to import a .bundle?
