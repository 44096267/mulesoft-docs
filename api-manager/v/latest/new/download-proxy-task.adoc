= To Download a Proxy

API Gateway, incorporated in Mule Runtime, is the server that hosts a Mule proxy application. To deploy an API from Anypoint Platform, you typically generate a proxy application by downloading it. The proxy serves to stop attacks aimed at the actual server. This proxy application is sometimes called an auto-generated proxy.
