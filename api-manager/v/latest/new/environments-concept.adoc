= About Environments in API Manager

The first thing you notice when you navigate to API Manager is the environment control bearing the name of your default environment. Sandbox is the default environment if you are an Organization Administrator:

When you click the environment control, a list of your environments appears. Legacy APIs and others that you haven't associated with an environment, such as an API you create in Design Center and publish to API Manager, are unclassified. You need to classify an API to manage it.

To give users access to an API, you need grant the user permission to the environment.
