= To Manage an API from Exchange

You need to have access an API published in your organization's Exchange to perform this task.

. After logging into Anypoint Platform, click API Manager.
. In API Administration, select Manage API > Import API From Exchange.
+
Manage API From Exchange appears.
. In Import API from Exchange, select import options:
+
* In API Name, search for and select the API you want to import from the list of published APIs.
* In API Version, select a version of the API published in Exchange.
* In Specification Version, select the version of the API specification published in Exchange.
+
A link to the RAML specification for viewing appears.
+
* Click Save.
+
// Why are there different options in Sandbox vs Unclassified?
+
* In Managing Type, choose Basic Endpoint or Endpoint with Proxy.
* Optionally, in Implementation URI, enter the URL of the site that hosts the API or accept the default, a dummy URI.
+
Typically, you accept the default. The URI is not required, and often unknown, at this point. 
* Click Save to import the API, or optionally set advanced options.
. In Advanced Options, optionally assign a name for the proxy, or accept the default name, and set a response timeout.
////
Under the following conditions, Save and Deploy also deploys the API:
+
* You are an API Versions Owner or are assigned the Organization Administrators role.
* You set the URL of the site earlier in this procedure.
