= To Manage an API from Exchange

You need to have access to an API in your organization's Exchange to perform this procedure. For example, in Design Center create an API and publish it to Exchange. After setting up the API to manage it from Exchange, the API version, status and other information appears in API Manager and you can configure and manage the API.

. Click API Manager in tne Anypoint Platform navigation bar.
+
API Administration opens in your default environment, such as Sandbox.
+
. In API Administration, select Manage API > Manage API From Exchange.

+
. In Manage API from Exchange, select import options:
+
* In API Name, search for and select the API you want to manage from the list of available APIs in Exchange.
* In API Version, select a version of the API.
* In Asset Version, select the Exchange asset version, which corresponds to the RAML version of the API.
+
A link to the RAML specification for viewing appears.
+
* In Managing Type, choose Basic Endpoint or Endpoint with Proxy.
+
If you do not plan to deploy the API on a public site, for example, and are not worried about attacks on your server, you configure the basic endpoint. Set up an endpoint with a proxy application to shield the API from attacks on the server. 
+
* In Implementation URI, optionally enter the URL of the site that hosts the API or accept the default, a dummy URI.
+
Typically, you accept the default. The URI is not required, and often unknown, at this point. 
* If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, select a proxy deployment target Cloudhub or Hybrid.
+
Hybrid is a server located outside Anypoint Platform but having metadata that's handled in the Anypoint Platform cloud.
+
If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, also accept the default Path `/` for the proxy endpoint, or enter another path. For example, changing the path to `/users` makes the REST call to the service at the implementation URI `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`. 
. Click Save, or optionally set advanced options, and then save.
. In Advanced Options, optionally assign a name for the proxy, or accept the default name, and set a response timeout.
