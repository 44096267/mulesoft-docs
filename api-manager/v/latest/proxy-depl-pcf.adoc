= To Deploy a Proxy to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

If you are using Anypoint Platform for PCF, you can deploy a proxy to a Mule runtime using the cf CLI. Before deploying a proxy, the backend application of the API must to be deployed on PCF.

To deploy the proxy, run the following command

----
cf bind-route-service <domain_name> <service_instance> -f --hostname <hostname> --c parameters.json
----

Using the following parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|domain_name| The domain where you want to host your proxy application
|service_instance | The proxy service. This services is different from the service name used when deploying your Mule application to PCF. You can have multiple instances of this proxy service in different PCF organizations and environments.
|`-f` (optional) | Forces the command to avoid any message prompts.
|`--hostname` | The host name of your proxy application.
|`-c <file>.json`| A JSON file containing PCF properties.
|===

The command you run should be similar to the following:

----
$ cf bind-route-service apps.pcf.mulesoft.com api_gateway_service --hostname myapp -c <file>.json
----

== The JSON Properties File

When deploying a proxy to PCF, the `cf bind-route-service` command uses a property file containing information about your installation. This file contains the following:

|===
|Property |Description
|`orgId` | The Anypoint Platform organization where the proxy application is deployed.
|`envId` | The Runtime Manager environment where the proxy application is deployed
|`appName` | The name of the application used in Runtime Manager. This is also the name of the API in API Manager.
|`--hostname` | The host name of your proxy application.
|'domain` | The domain name of your application. It should match the domain provided as input to the `cf bind-route-service` command.
