= To Deploy a Proxy to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

If you are using Anypoint Platform for PCF, you can deploy a proxy to a Mule runtime in your PCF installation.

Also, the API's backend application needs to be deployed on the PCF platform before you can run the command that executes the deployment.

Currently, this modality is only available on the command line. To instruct PCF to create and deploy a proxy, you must run the command `cf bind-route-service`. This command must include the following arguments:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|*Domain* name| Domain where you want to host your proxy application
|*service instance* name | Refers to the link:http://docs.pivotal.io/mulesoft/installing.html[proxy service], which is different from the service used when link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-pcf[deploying Mule applications to PCF]. You might have multiple instances of this proxy service, as you'd have one per every link:/access-management/organization[organization] and link:/access-management/environments[environment] you own.
|`-f`| *(optional)* Force command to avoid any message prompts.
|`--hostname` | The host name under which your proxy app is deployed. If `nodejs-app.apps.pcf.com` is the URL to reach your proxy, then `nodejs-app` is the hostname and `apps.pcf.com` is the domain.
|`-c parameters.json`| Reference to a .JSON file that contains more information. Its required structure is explained below.
|===

Your command should look like this:

[code]
----
$ cf bind-route-service apps.pcf.mulesoft.com api_gateway_service --hostname myapp -c input.json
----

== Parameters File

One of your properties should be a link to a JSON parameters file. This file should include the following information:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|`orgId` | The Anypoint Platform link:/access-management/organization[organization] in which to deploy the proxy application
|`envId` | The Runtime Manager link:/access-management/environments[environment] in which to deploy the proxy application
|`appName` | The name with which you want your proxy application to be registered on Runtime Manager. It will also register an API on API Manager under this same name. You will also see the proxy listed under this name if you execute the command `cf apps`.
|`--hostname` | The host name under which your proxy app is deployed. If `nodejs-app.apps.pcf.com` is the URL to reach your proxy, then `nodejs-app` is the hostname and `apps.pcf.com` is the domain.
|'domain` | The domain name where you want to host your application. It should match the domain that you provided as properties on the command.
| `muleRuntimeVersion` | Mule Runtime version with which to run the deployment of the proxy
| `anypointServiceName`| The name of the PCF service that you registered in the Space configuration tool
|`repFactor`| (optional) In case you want your proxy to be deployed on multiple PCF instances.
|===

Your file should hence resemble the following example:

[source, json, linenums]
----
{
    "orgId": "e2ccc210-95a3-4740-b9cf-1f2d9e693168",
    "envId": "26ad04b9-422c-45f2-8ee0-caeb73e6c9a9",
    "appName": "proxyApp",
    "hostname": "myapp",
    "muleRuntimeVersion": "3.8.1",
   "anypointServiceName": "runtime-manager-service",
    "domain":"apps.pcf.mulesoft.com"
}
