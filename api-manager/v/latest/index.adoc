API Manager is a component of Anypoint Platform for registering, designing, building, managing, and publishing APIs. Anypoint Platform uses Mule as its core runtime engine for managing APIs. You can use API Manager on a public cloud, such as CloudHub, a private cloud, or a hybrid. A hybrid deployment is an API deployed on a private server but having metadata processed in the public cloud. 

Sign up to use Anypoint Platform or obtain credentials from your administrator. If you set up your own account in Anypoint Platform, you are assigned the Organization Administrators role. In this link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/access-management/roles[role], you see API Manager when you log into Anypoint Platform. and then log in to access API Manager. On the Anypoint Platform web site, open API Manager. Alternatively, you can use the Anypoint Platform command line interface (CLI) to interact with API Manager.

== API Manager Overview

After opening API Manager, the API Administration page appears. From this starting point, you can navigate to controls for managing the API. Here are a few of the  management tasks you can perform:

* Register an API
+
** Import an API
** Create an API using API Designer
** Use the auto-discovery process to register and start a Mule app.
+
In this case registration and start up occurs without user intervention.
+
* Base the API definition on the RAML specification using the API Designer within API Manager. 
+
* Simulate calls to the API.
+
* Apply one or more policies, such as the Client ID Enforcement, to each API version. 
+
* Configure an endpoint and deploy an API.

You can deploy an API implementation to a Mule Runtime that runs on a server, such as CloudHub. Each server belongs to an environment, such as Dev, Test, or Production, which you monitor using Runtime Manager. Servers are defined in business groups and each business group can have multiple environments. You publish your API on the portal and apps request access, as depicted in the following diagram.
