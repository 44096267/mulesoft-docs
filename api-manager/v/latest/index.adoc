API Manager is the Anypoint Platform system console for managing API-related operations. As a member of the Organization Administrator role, you can perform these operations:

* Importing an API to manage it in Anypoint Platform
* Promoting an API from one environment to another
* Deploying an API or a proxy for it
* Managing an API: 
** Getting an API update and versioning
** Changing a deployment name
** Deprecating, exporting, and deleting an API version from API Manager
** Applying and managing policies
** Generating and viewing API analytics

From API Manager, you can also manage client applications that access an API. 

API Manager can discover and register an API or Mule app deployed from Studio or Design Center without user intervention if the API uses auto-discovery.
