= API Manager 

API Manager is available in two versions: the new, and the classic version. If you create an Anypoint Platform account after the November 18 2.1 release, you use the new API Manager to manage APIs. Otherwise, you use the classic version of API Manager until you migrate your APIs to the latest Anypoint Platform. Anypoint Platform opens the right version of API Manager for you automatically.

If you have the Crowd release can use the Design Center to author and update RAML specifications. Deployment to CloudHub occurs automatically as you design an API in Design Center. To deploy an API proxy to other servers, you can use API Manager. In API manager, you govern how users access the API through policies and SLA tiers.
