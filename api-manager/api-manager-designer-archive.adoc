= API Designer (Archive)

The Design Center release unified the setup and design of an API for governance in API Manager. Depending on your entitlements, the legacy API Designer might or might not be visible in Anypoint Platform. 

If you have existing designs in API Designer, continue using the legacy tools. For new API design, Design Center is recommended.
